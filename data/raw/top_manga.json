        "synopsis": "Guts, a former mercenary now known as the Black Swordsman, is out for revenge. After a tumultuous childhood, he finally finds someone he respects and believes he can trust, only to have everything fall apart when this person takes away everything important to Guts for the purpose of fulfilling his own desires. Now marked for death, Guts becomes condemned to a fate in which he is relentlessly pursued by demonic beings.\n\nSetting out on a dreadful quest riddled with misfortune, Guts, armed with a massive sword and monstrous strength, will let nothing stop him, not even death itself, until he is finally able to take the head of the one who stripped him—and his loved one—of their humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 14: Berserk: The Prototype",

        "synopsis": "In the American Old West, the world's greatest race is about to begin. Thousands line up in San Diego to travel over six thousand kilometers for a chance to win the grand prize of fifty million dollars. With the era of the horse reaching its end, contestants are allowed to use any kind of vehicle they wish. Competitors will have to endure grueling conditions, traveling up to a hundred kilometers a day through uncharted wastelands. The Steel Ball Run is truly a one-of-a-kind event.\n\nThe youthful Johnny Joestar, a crippled former horse racer, has come to San Diego to watch the start of the race. There he encounters Gyro Zeppeli, a racer with two steel balls at his waist instead of a gun. Johnny witnesses Gyro using one of his steel balls to unleash a fantastical power, compelling a man to fire his gun at himself during a duel. In the midst of the action, Johnny happens to touch the steel ball and feels a power surging through his legs, allowing him to stand up for the first time in two years. Vowing to find the secret of the steel balls, Johnny decides to compete in the race, and so begins his bizarre adventure across America on the Steel Ball Run.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In 16th-century Japan, Shinmen Takezou is a wild, rough young man in both his appearance and his actions. His aggressive nature has won him the collective reproach and fear of his village, leading him and his best friend, Matahachi Honiden, to run away in search of something grander than provincial life. The pair enlist in the Toyotomi army, yearning for glory—but when the Toyotomi suffer a crushing defeat at the hands of the Tokugawa Clan at the Battle of Sekigahara, the friends barely make it out alive.\n\nAfter the two are separated, Shinmen returns home on a self-appointed mission to notify the Hon'iden family of Matahachi's survival. He instead finds himself a wanted criminal, framed for his friend's supposed murder based on his history of violence. Upon being captured, he is strung up on a tree and left to die. An itinerant monk, the distinguished Takuan Soho, takes pity on the \"devil child,\" secretly freeing Shinmen and christening him with a new name to avoid pursuit by the authorities: Musashi Miyamoto.\n\nVagabond is the fictitious retelling of the life of one of Japan's most renowned swordsmen, the \"Sword Saint\" Musashi Miyamoto—his rise from a swordsman with no desire other than to become \"Invincible Under the Heavens\" to an enlightened warrior who slowly learns of the importance of close friends, self-reflection, and life itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the end, Tenma decides to gamble his reputation by saving Johan, effectively leaving the mayor for dead.\n\nAs a consequence of his actions, hospital director Heinemann strips Tenma of his position, and Heinemann's daughter Eva breaks off their engagement. Disgraced and shunned by his colleagues, Tenma loses all hope of a successful career—that is, until the mysterious killing of Heinemann gives him another chance.\n\nNine years later, Tenma is the head of the surgical department and close to becoming the director himself. Although all seems well for him at first, he soon becomes entangled in a chain of gruesome murders that have taken place throughout Germany. The culprit is a monster—the same one that Tenma saved on that fateful day nine years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Thorfinn, son of one of the Vikings' greatest warriors, is among the finest fighters in the merry band of mercenaries run by the cunning Askeladd, an impressive feat for a person his age. However, Thorfinn is not part of the group for the plunder it entails—instead, for having caused his family great tragedy, the boy has vowed to kill Askeladd in a fair duel. Not yet skilled enough to defeat him, but unable to abandon his vengeance, Thorfinn spends his boyhood with the mercenary crew, honing his skills on the battlefield among the war-loving Danes, where killing is just another pleasure of life.\n\nOne day, when Askeladd receives word that Danish prince Canute has been taken hostage, he hatches an ambitious plot—one that will decide the next King of England and drastically alter the lives of Thorfinn, Canute, and himself. Set in 11th-century Europe, Vinland Saga tells a bloody epic in an era where violence, madness, and injustice are inescapable, providing a paradise for the battle-crazed and utter hell for the rest who live in it.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Hanamichi Sakuragi, a tall, boisterous teenager with flame-red hair and physical strength beyond his years, is eager to put an end to his rejection streak of 50 and finally score a girlfriend as he begins his first year of Shohoku High. However, his reputation for delinquency and destructiveness precedes him, and most of his fellow students subsequently avoid him like the plague. As his first day of school ends, he is left with two strong thoughts: \"I hate basketball\" and \"I need a girlfriend.\"\n\nHaruko Akagi, ignorant of Hanamichi's history of misbehavior, notices his immense height and unwittingly approaches him, asking whether or not he likes basketball. Overcome by the fact that a girl is speaking to him, the red-haired giant blurts out a yes despite his true feelings. At the gym, Haruko asks if he can do a slam dunk. Though a complete novice, Hanamachi palms the ball and makes the leap...but overshoots, slamming his head into the backboard. Amazed by his near-inhuman physical abilities, Haruko quickly notifies the school's basketball captain of his feat. With this, Hanamichi is unexpectedly thrust into a world of competition for a girl he barely knows, but he soon discovers that there is perhaps more to basketball than he once thought.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Slam Dunk won the 40th Shogakukan Manga Award in the Shounen category in 1994. As of 2017, over 170 million copies of the series are in circulation. The manga's wide success led to a large increase in the popularity of basketball among Japanese youth. In 2010, Takehiko Inoue received special commendations from the Japan Basketball Association for popularizing basketball in Japan. The series was published in English by Gutsoon! Entertainment under the Raijin Comics Imprint for five volumes from July 2, 2003, to May 5, 2004. After Gutsoon's shutdown, VIZ Media purchased the publishing rights and republished the series under the Shonen Jump imprint from September 2, 2008, to December 3, 2013.

        "synopsis": "Alchemists are knowledgeable and naturally talented individuals who can manipulate and modify matter due to their art. Yet despite the wide range of possibilities, alchemy is not as all-powerful as most would believe. Human transmutation is strictly forbidden, and whoever attempts it risks severe consequences. Even so, siblings Edward and Alphonse Elric decide to ignore this great taboo and bring their mother back to life. Unfortunately, not only do they fail in resurrecting her, they also pay an extremely high price for their arrogance: Edward loses his left leg and Alphonse his entire body. Furthermore, Edward also gives up his right arm in order to seal his brother's soul into a suit of armor.\n\nYears later, the young alchemists travel across the country looking for the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of recovering their old bodies with its power. However, their quest for the fated stone also leads them to unravel far darker secrets than they could ever imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Shrouded in the fog of history and darkness, who or what is the lurking evil that murmurs into our ears?\n\nWaking up to be faced with a string of mysteries, Zhou Mingrui finds himself reincarnated as Klein Moretti in an alternate Victorian era world where he sees a world filled with machinery, cannons, dreadnoughts, airships, difference machines, as well as Potions, Divination, Hexes, Tarot Cards, Sealed Artifacts...\n\nThe Light continues to shine but mystery has never gone far. Follow Klein as he finds himself entangled with the Churches of the world—both orthodox and unorthodox—while he slowly develops newfound powers thanks to the Beyonder potions.\n\nLike the corresponding tarot card, The Fool, which is numbered 0—a number of unlimited potential—this is the legend of \"The Fool.\"\n\n(Source: Webnovel)",

As he moves into his uncle's scuba diving shop, Grand Blue, he eagerly anticipates his dream college life, filled with beautiful girls and good friends.\n\nBut things don't exactly go according to plan. Upon entering the shop, he encounters a group of rowdy, naked upperclassmen, who immediately coerce him into participating in their alcoholic activities. Though unwilling at first, Iori quickly gives in and becomes the heart and soul of the party. Unfortunately, this earns him the scorn of his cousin, Chisa Kotegawa, who walks in at precisely the wrong time. Undeterred, Iori still vows to realize his ideal college life, but will things go according to plan this time, or will his situation take yet another dive?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While mysterious \"Constellations\" watch the unwilling participants for their own entertainment, one man emerges as the protagonist: Yoo Joonghyuk, who repeatedly lives and dies in an endless struggle to close the book on this indiscriminate torture.\n\nKim Dokja has lived a challenging and action-packed life through Joonghyuk for over a decade. While other readers abandoned the story early on, Dokja has remained its sole reader until the very last chapter. At that time, he receives a puzzling message from the author, and the novel's inhumane world suddenly becomes reality.\n\nAs the only person aware of what lies ahead, Dokja realizes that he must utilize his omniscience to navigate the deadly scenarios and stay alive. Dokja was never meant to play a main part, but in defiance of those who wish to spell his fate, he might just have to take the lead in writing his own conclusion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Parting ways, Xin and Piao promise each other to one day become the greatest generals in the world.

        "synopsis": "Punpun Onodera is a normal 11-year-old boy living in Japan. Hopelessly idealistic and romantic, Punpun begins to see his life take a subtle—though nonetheless startling—turn to the adult when he meets the new girl in his class, Aiko Tanaka. It is then that the quiet boy learns just how fickle maintaining a relationship can be, and the surmounting difficulties of transitioning from a naive boyhood to a convoluted adulthood. When his father assaults his mother one night, Punpun realizes another thing: those whom he looked up to were not as impressive as he once thought.\n\nAs his problems increase, Punpun's once shy demeanor turns into voluntary reclusiveness. Rather than curing him of his problems and conflicting emotions, this merely intensifies them, sending him down the dark path of maturity in this grim coming-of-age saga.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Long ago, Earth was struck by six meteorites, creating six moons and leaving a lone island in their wake. Those who could not make it to the island sank to the bottom of the ocean, where, over time, they slowly turned to crystal. As countless millennia passed, 28 of these crystallized lifeforms, known as the Lustrous, rose from the depths and resided on the island. Led by the wise Kongou-sensei, they must defend themselves against the seemingly infinite number of Lunarians, inhabitants of the moons who seek to harvest their valuable bodies for crafting weapons and jewelry. \n\nHouseki no Kuni centers around Phosphophyllite, a young gem about to turn three hundred years old. Clumsy, extremely fragile, and having no visible talent, they are one of the weakest gems around, unable to help in the fight against the Lunarians in any meaningful way. But as the battle with the otherworldly invaders rages on, they soon learn that power comes at a cost that no one should have to pay.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Joe Yabuki has learned how to toughen up and stop trusting others after a troubling youth spent bouncing between orphanages and fending off bullies. After finally escaping the cycle of violent temporary homes, Joe adopts a delinquent lifestyle in the streets of San'ya, a slum in Tokyo. He makes his way through the world with his fists, picking fights with anyone he pleases.\n\nDanpei Tange, a washed-up and alcoholic former boxing coach, notices Joe's animalistic combat ability and attempts to mentor the wild teenager. Despite developing an explosive relationship, the two form a close bond and rely on each other to look after the other homeless children in San'ya.\n\nUnable to abandon his destructive habits, Joe is arrested for petty crimes. In jail, he meets and fights with lifelong friends and rivals, including the boxing prodigy Tooru Rikiishi. Continuously challenging Rikiishi to fights, Joe is knocked out time after time due to his savage brawling style failing in the face of Rikiishi's controlled boxing technique. But eventually, Joe stuns his rival with a knockout blow, earning Rikiishi's respect and the promise that they will one day meet again inside the professional ring.\n\nFinding a reason to live within boxing, Joe takes life head-on with a new purpose. As he rises through Japan's amateur and professional boxing scenes, he contends with painful loss and increasing injury. Joe's passion for fighting is all-consuming, and he grapples with the idea that a life without boxing may not be one worth living.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

And probably not for the better.\n\nKenji Endo is a normal convenience store manager who's just trying to get by. But when he learns that one of his old friends going by the name \"Donkey\" has suddenly committed suicide, and that a new cult led by a figure known as \"Friend\" is becoming more notorious, Kenji starts to feel that something isn't right. With a few key clues left behind by his deceased friend, Kenji realizes that this cult is much more than he ever thought it would be—not only is this mysterious organization directly targeting him and his childhood friends, but the whole world also faces a grave danger that only the friends have the key to stop.\n\nKenji's simple life of barely making ends meet is flipped upside down when he reunites with his childhood friends, and together they must figure out the truth of how their past is connected to the cult, as the turn of the century could mean the possible end of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Able to control the dead, Wei Wuxian left an epochal dent in the cultivation world, still both feared and revered 13 years later. But when he awakens in the body of a bullied young man who sacrificed his soul to take revenge on his cruel family, Wei Wuxian is faced with trouble once more.\n\nHowever, Wei Wuxian was a mischievous yet brilliant cultivator, and he is not one to be constrained. Using his dark skills, Wei Wuxian interrupts a ritual to capture a powerful cursed arm handled by Lan Sect—a prominent cultivation sect of Gusu, the home of his former acquaintance, the esteemed and poised Lan Wangji.\n\nDespite wishing to hide his past life, Wei Wuxian inevitably gets entangled in the sinister web of the ruling cultivation sects' deepest secrets. With Lan Wangji, he attempts to solve the mystery of the demonic arm, but it is soon apparent that they are only scratching the surface—and the truth may just hold the key to his once disgraceful downfall.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When she and her adoptive father, Yousuke, move to a new city, the energetic young girl naturally sets out to investigate the neighborhood on her own.\n\nAfter a few incidents at the local park, the Koiwais become acquainted with their neighbors, the Ayase family. Their three daughters—mischievous college student Asagi, responsible high school student Fuuka, and kindhearted grade school student Ena—eventually all take a liking to Yotsuba and join in on her antics, despite their sheer ridicule.\n\nFrom learning how to use a swing to figuring out how to stop global warming with air conditioners, Yotsuba's ability to infallibly find fun in everything, both amazes and annoys the people around her. Along with Yousuke, the Ayases, and friends she makes along the way, Yotsuba embarks on daily adventures, each one a step in her quest to enjoy the simple things in life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their tragic rendezvous results in the end of Araragi's life as a human and his subsequent rebirth as a vampire—a monster. However, this encounter is only the start of his meddlings with the supernatural. Koyomi's noble personality ultimately sees him getting further involved in the lives of others with supernatural afflictions. This is his desperate attempt at returning to a normal human life, in a paranormal world filled with nothing but tragedy, suffering, and inhumanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nThis entry includes the first season of the Monogatari Series.",

A story about choices and consequences, confessions resulting in love and rejection, and decisions leading to sacrifice and tragedy.\n\nKoyomi Araragi's decision to save a blonde vampire and meddle with the supernatural resulted in his death as a human and rebirth as a monster. But this was only one of the countless tragedies and choices that Koyomi would be faced with, and he is confronted with the fact that his seemingly unshakeable and hard-earned relationships do not last. As strange oddities continue to manifest in the world around him, he is faced with impossible choices—to sever his ties with those he loves, or eternally remain a part of the world of monsters and apparitions and watch the world crumble as a result. To accept or reject a confession, and sacrifice his all for the sake of others. However, both of these paths could lead to tragedy and farewells.\n\nThis is a story. A story about Koyomi Araragi coming to realize the consequences of his choices.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nThis entry includes the second season of the Monogatari Series.",

The two are often regarded as the perfect couple by students despite them not being in any sort of romantic relationship.\n\nHowever, the truth is that after spending so much time together, the two have developed feelings for one another; unfortunately, neither is willing to confess, as doing so would be a sign of weakness. With their pride as elite students on the line, Miyuki and Kaguya embark on a quest to do whatever is necessary to get a confession out of the other. Through their daily antics, the battle of love begins!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Having to sell his personal items to make ends meet, Kusonoki is offered the chance to sell his lifespan to earn some money. But it is revealed he could part ways with his remaining 30 years of life at a paltry rate—which means that he will never find happiness in this life. Rather than endure misery, Kusonoki decides to sell his life expectancy, leaving him with three months to live.\n\nFeeling liberated from social norms, he sets a series of goals for himself, one of which is to clarify his feelings for his childhood friend Himeno. Meanwhile, Miyagi, the clerk who bought his lifespan, is sent to monitor his activities in the case that Kusunoki may exhibit anti-social behavior. Although annoyed by Miyagi's constant presence, Kusunoki will do everything he can to find a purpose to his existence in the remaining time that he has left.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, other obstacles present themselves throughout—including the frustrated, balding vice principal, Hiroshi Uchiyamada; old enemies from his biker days; and his own idiotic teaching methods. But Eikichi fights it all whilst trying to help his students, romance fellow teacher Azusa Fuyutsuki, and earn his self-proclaimed title.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso contains the gaiden \"GTO: Great Toroko Oppai♡\" (Tomoko's Big Adventures).",

But what lies behind his prodigious facade is a teenage boy who suffers immense pressure from both his family and from the high expectations from the shogi community. Rei moves out to live a more independent life away from his family, but his unorganized lifestyle and unsociable personality show no signs of improvement.\n\nHowever, in a twist of fate that will prove to be a turning point in his life, Rei encounters the Kawamoto sisters—the motherly Akari, the passionate Hinata, and the energetic Momo—who take great care of him. 3-gatsu no Lion tells the story of Rei as he reshapes his melancholic life and picks up the courage to begin facing the problems he evaded during his past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, his team is utterly defeated in their first game against the powerhouse school Kitagawa Daiichi, led by the genius, but oppressive setter dubbed the \"King of the Court,\" Tobio Kageyama.\n\nHinata enrolls into Karasuno High School seeking to take revenge against Kageyama in an official high school match and to follow in the Little Giant's footsteps—but his plans are ruined when he opens the gymnasium door to find Kageyama as one of his teammates.\n\nNow, Hinata must establish himself on the team and work alongside the problematic Kageyama to overcome his shortcomings and to fulfill his dream of making it to the top of the high school volleyball world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 14: Nisekyuu!!",

        "synopsis": "Shouya Ishida, a mischievous elementary school student, finds himself troubled by deaf transfer student Shouko Nishimiya. Despite her genuine attempts to befriend her new classmates, Shouko only proves herself to be an annoyance for Shouya and his friends, provoking them to ridicule her at any possible chance. Soon enough, their taunts turn into constant assault—yet the teachers heartlessly remain apathetic to the situation.\n\nShouya's misdeeds are finally stopped when Shouko transfers to another school. Denying their involvement, the entire class puts the blame on Shouya. As the new victim of bullying, Shouya gradually becomes meek and reclusive, being treated with contempt and disregard for years to come.\n\nNow a high school student, Shouya meets Shouko again for the first time in five years. Still tormented by his past actions, Shouya is determined to make amends for his mistakes and confront his trauma—even if he must face arduous obstacles along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The end to his indecision has finally come. Piece by piece, his humanity was falling away, starting with his reflection. He was becoming one of them—a vampire.\n\nNow, Araragi must choose which world to live in and which to give up. To remain human, he must abandon the friends he made through encounters with the supernatural. On the other hand, he would have to sacrifice his humanity to stay with those he holds dear. \n\nKoyomi Araragi must decide, and his decision will haunt him until the very end. Either way, tragedy seems inevitable, a culmination of every choice made since the very beginning.\n \n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nThis entry includes the final season of the Monogatari Series.",

The four—mage Frieren, hero Himmel, priest Heiter, and warrior Eisen—reminisce about their decade-long journey as the moment to bid each other farewell arrives. But the passing of time is different for elves, thus Frieren witnesses her companions slowly pass away one by one.\n\nBefore his death, Heiter manages to foist a young human apprentice called Fern onto Frieren. Driven by the elf's passion for collecting a myriad of magic spells, the pair embarks on a seemingly aimless journey, revisiting the places that the heroes of yore had visited. Along their travels, Frieren slowly confronts her regrets of missed opportunities to form deeper bonds with her now-deceased comrades.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Nine years ago, the Empire of Giad declared war on all neighboring countries using an army of autonomous drones known as the Legion. Threatened by the soulless killing machines, the Republic of San Magnolia, home to the silver-haired Alba race, evacuated its citizens inside 85 districts and developed supposedly unmanned drones known as Juggernauts to counter the Legion. Even after years of war, the Republic boasts that they have suffered zero casualties. However, the battlefield bathed in crimson recites a different melody.\n\nThe hand dealt to the Colorata people—a minority forced into living in the \"nonexistent\" 86th district—is one of utter contempt and scorn. Looked upon as human filth, they are ordered to pilot the Juggernauts as Processors under the command of Republican Handlers.\n\nVladilena Milizé, a republican soldier with a strong sense of justice, detests the way her countrymen treat the 86. When she is assigned to the Spearhead Squadron as their handler, she meets a group of oddballs and eventually grows attached to them—particularly their captain, Shinei Nouzen, a boy with a pure sense of purpose and resolve. However, the path they walk is one riddled with death, and growing close to an 86 may have just set Vladilena down a path of despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With knowledge, experience, and regrets from his previous life retained, Rudeus vows to lead a fulfilling life and not repeat his past mistakes.\n\nNow gifted with a tremendous amount of magical power as well as the mind of a grown adult, Rudeus is seen as a genius in the making by his new parents. Soon, he finds himself studying under powerful warriors, such as his swordsman father and a mage named Roxy Migurdia—all in order to hone his apparent talents.

Time passed, and this tale became a legend to tell children.\n\nAs the sole princess of Kouka, Yona lives a life of lavish ease. In love with her cousin, Su-won, and protected by her bodyguard, Son Hak, she wants for nothing and remains sheltered from the harrowing reality outside the castle walls. Contrary to this peaceful illusion, Kouka is about to undergo a political upheaval. After her beloved Su-won stages a bloody coup and murders her father, Yona is forced to flee with only Hak by her side.\n\nThough surrounded by enemies on all sides, the banished princess still yearns to save her kingdom. Her solution comes from an exiled priest, who tells her that her only hope is to find the four legendary dragon warriors. Guided by this seemingly fictitious myth, Yona sets out to find these warriors, determined to restore her kingdom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Humanity, once a technologically advanced and thriving civilization, has been pushed to the brink of extinction following a cataclysmic war known as the Seven Days of Fire. The remnants of the human race now live in scattered kingdoms to avoid the unrelenting spread of the Sea of Corruption, a colossal forest infested with dangerous mutant insects and fungi that produce poisonous spores.\n\nNausicaä, the sole heir to the throne of the agricultural kingdom Valley of the Wind, is thrust into war after an ally kingdom, the imperialist Torumekia, invades the Dorok Empire. Forced to fight alongside the Torumekian military and their cunning princess Kushana, Nausicaä witnesses firsthand the horrors of war and its effect on both humanity and the environment. With her uncanny charisma and gentle nature, Nausicaä may be the only hope for humanity as the ongoing war and the Sea of Corruption hasten the extinction of mankind.\n\nSet against the backdrop of a devastated world, Kaze no Tani no Nausicaä depicts the aftermath of human folly and the immortal power of nature.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While the latter boasts an immaculate reputation and favors students from wealthy backgrounds, the former is a nest for dim-witted delinquents. Everyone at Kikyo harbors a deep hatred for their Chidori neighbors.\n\nSixteen-year-old Rintarou Tsumugi is a student at Chidori whose intimidating face leads people to avoid him. Rintarou pays no mind to this, as he is content with his group of friends. However, there is something he has not told them yet: sometimes, he helps out at his family's cake shop.\n\nOne day at work, Rintarou sees a customer at a table, but she runs off before he can talk to her. The next day, he receives an apology from the girl, Kaoruko Waguri, who explains that she did not run away because of his appearance and that she believes Rintarou is a kind-hearted person. Although he is not used to Kaoruko's bright personality, Rintarou looks forward to forming a friendship with her. There is just one obstacle that stands in his way: Kaoruko is a Kikyo student!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is what Mori Buntarou trains, works, and lives for.\n\nHis climb to the top starts when he transfers to a new high school. Despite his lonesome and solitary nature, Mori's classmates persuade him to climb the school building. Without a harness or hesitation, he begins his scale to reach the top. Edging past the point of no return, he halts when he is faced with a final intimidating obstacle—a horizontal overhang. Adrenaline courses through him, and Mori jumps for the final hold at the summit.\n\nFrom there, he casts his eyes upon something that he normally would not have seen—another peak, another goal. With an awakened passion and newfound purpose in life, Mori explores the breathtaking sport of rock climbing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Exiting the convenience store, Subaru Natsuki emerges to a busy town inhabited by humans and demi-humans. Using dragons and carriages as transportation, the town is clearly not the modern-day Japan that he is familiar with. However, as someone who spends his days engrossed in comics and games, Subaru assumes that he is a protagonist in this new fantasy world, harnessing supreme magical powers.\n\nMuch to his dismay, that is not the case and things quickly go awry as he bumps into a group of thugs. Fortunately, a silver-haired beauty named Satella comes to his rescue, while looking for her stolen insignia. In return for her kindness, Subaru offers to help with the search, which eventually leads them to a loot shop. Assuming that the insignia was traded for money, Subaru enters the shop hoping to negotiate with the owner regarding the stolen item. However, much to his surprise, what awaits them is not the insignia but a brutal assassin that leads the two to their demise.\n\nBut instead of waking up in the afterlife, Subaru is shocked to find himself standing alone in the midst of daytime, as if he never left the town in the first place. Thus, his life in another world mysteriously begins a second time.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He is the eldest son, yet all he does is drink and intimidate others, depleting what little is left of his family's wealth. The Fronteras' knight, Javier Asrahan, is destined to become a renowned swordmaster, and Lloyd's family will face pitiful deaths as their entire land falls to ruin under insurmountable debt.\n\nThough at some point Kim Suho was an average civil engineering student in Korea, he suddenly wakes up on a dirt road as none other than Lloyd, an ungrateful hooligan from the beginning of a book following Javier, the protagonist. While a sassy status window offers some clarity about his new identity, Suho is rather worried about his imminent downfall.\n\nTo avoid becoming a beggar—and ultimately lead a sweet and comfortable life—Suho decides to fix Lloyd's scumbag image. With his engineering expertise and magical construction skills boost, Suho introduces modern innovations and city developments to this medieval-like world, drastically improving the people's quality of life—all for a nice sum of money.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

At this seemingly perfect institution, the reserved Kiyotaka Ayanokouji arrives as an incoming member of class 1-D, where he befriends one of his classmates, the antisocial Suzune Horikita.\n\nAt first, his peers revel in the academy's leisurely lifestyle, taking advantage of all of its state-of-the-art facilities. Soon enough, however, the facade of Tokyo Metropolitan Advanced Nurturing High School gives way to its true nature—only the top scoring classes can fully utilize the school's offerings, and Class D is the furthest from such a status. Standing at the bottom of the hierarchy, Class D houses all of the school's \"worst\" students.\n\nFollowing this rude awakening, Ayanokouji, Horikita, and the rest of Class D must overcome their differences and clash against other classes in order to climb to the coveted position of Class A by any means necessary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite continually facing failure in her quest for love, her spirits have never dampened. At the age of 20, she finds herself on a train to Tokyo with hopes of reuniting with her current boyfriend.\n\nNana Osaki, on the other hand, is feisty and prideful. After joining a local band during her high school days, she falls in love with music and one of the band members. However, when faced with the choice between her relationship and her musical career, she chooses the latter and separates from her boyfriend. On her 20th birthday, she boards the same train to Tokyo, like her namesake, where she aims to become a top vocalist.\n\nThe two girls with the same name but very different aspirations find themselves sitting together on their journey to the city, and, as fate would have it, eventually share the same apartment. A deep and unique bond is then forged, where they will support each other in this saga of love, music, friendship, and heartbreak.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Urano Motosu's lifelong dream to become a librarian comes true. Luck is not on her side, however, as a plethora of books falls on her during an earthquake. On the verge of death, she begs God to be reborn surrounded by nothing but books.\n\nHer wish is fulfilled, albeit not how she expected: Urano is reincarnated as Myne—a sickly five-year-old child with an ardent desire to read—in another world where the upper class controls knowledge, and only the privileged have access to written works. As a commoner, Myne is distraught that she will never be able to find what she is yearning for.\n\nTo obtain books, Myne decides she should make them herself. Currently, she is but a kid thrust into an unknown place—but nothing will not stop Myne from achieving her goal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Noticing his poverty, an old shop owner directs him to a store that supposedly purchases lifespan, time, and health. While not completely believing the man's words, Kusunoki nevertheless finds himself at the address out of desperation and curiosity.\n\nKusunoki is crushed when he finds out the true monetary value of his lifespan—totaling a meager three hundred thousand yen. Deciding to sell the next 30 years of his life for ten thousand yen per year, Kusunoki is left with only three months to live. After heading home with the money, he is greeted by an unexpected visitor: the same store clerk he sold his lifespan to. She introduces herself as Miyagi, the one tasked with the job of observing him until the last three days of his life.\n\nJumyou wo Kaitotte Moratta. Ichinen ni Tsuki, Ichimanen de. follows the remaining three months of Kusunoki's life as he confronts lingering regrets from the past and discovers what truly gives life value.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Maomao, an unassuming girl raised in an unassuming town by her apothecary father, never imagined the rear palace would have anything to do with her—until she was kidnapped and sold into service there.\n\nThough she looks ordinary, Maomao has a quick wit, a sharp mind, and an extensive knowledge of medicine. That's her secret, until she encounters a resident of the palace at least as perceptive as she is: the head eunuch, Jinshi. He sees through Maomao's façade and makes her a lady-in-waiting to none other than the Emperor's favorite consort... so she can taste the lady's food for poison!\n\nAt her lady's side, Maomao starts to learn about everything that goes on in the rear palace—not all of it seemly. Can she ever lead a quiet life, or will her powers of deduction and insatiable curiosity bring her ever more adventures, and ever more dangers?\n\n(Source: J-Novel Club)",

With the third-years having graduated and incoming first-years entering the school, alliances are well underway. Additionally, now that Miyabi Nagumo is the student council president, the promise of turning the school into a meritocracy may become a reality.\n\nMeanwhile, conflicts between classes continue to build as the class point totals draw close.

Guilds are spurred on by this promise, traversing the labyrinthine dungeon in search of the magician. Laios Touden, the leader of one such guild, encounters a dragon that wipes out his party and devours his sister, Falin. Despite having lost the entirety of their supplies and belongings, Laios along with Marcille Donato, an elven healer, and Chilchuck Tims, a halfling thief, immediately reenter the dungeon, determined to save Falin.\n\nTime being of the essence, Laios suggests the taboo of eating the monsters of the dungeon as a means of gathering supplies. Upon the preparation of their first meal in the dungeon, they are stopped by an on-looking dwarf named Senshi. An enthusiast of monster cooking, he helps them prepare their monster ingredients for safe consumption. After learning of Laios' circumstances, Senshi expresses his desire to cook a dragon and joins their guild, thus beginning their food-filled foray into the dungeon together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "\"A big brother must always stay ahead of his younger brother. That is my responsibility as the older sibling\"—these are the words that have always motivated Mutta Nanba to try his best when it came to his younger brother, Hibito. So naturally, in the summer of 2006 when the Nanba brothers witness something strange in the night sky, Hibito declared that he would become an astronaut and travel to the Moon, while Mutta countered with the affirmation that he would go to Mars. That was the promise they made to each other.\n\nNow in 2025, while Hibito is working with NASA and preparing to become the first Japanese to land on the moon, Mutta has been fired from his job in an automotive development company. Having difficulty finding another job, Mutta is given a lifetime opportunity when he receives a letter from JAXA—the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency—telling him that he has been accepted to participate in the next astronaut selection. As if fate has given him a chance to fulfill the promise he made all those years ago, Mutta undertakes the difficult challenge of going to space.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Hachiman Hikigaya, a student in Soubu High School, is a cynical loner due to his traumatic past experiences in his social life. This eventually led to him developing a set of \"dead fish eyes\" and a twisted personality similar to that of a petty criminal. Believing that the concept of youth is a lie made up by youngsters who face their failures in denial, he turns in an essay that criticizes this exact mentality of youths. Irritated by the submission, his homeroom teacher, Shizuka Hiratsuka, forces him to join the Volunteer Service Club—a club that assists students to solve their problems in life, hoping that helping other people would change his personality.\n\nHowever, Yukino Yukinoshita, the most beautiful girl in school, is surprisingly the sole member of the club and a loner, albeit colder and smarter than Hikigaya. Their club soon expands when Yui Yuigahama joins them after being helped with her plight, and they begin to accept more requests.\n\nWith his status quo as a recluse, Hikigaya attempts to solve problems in his own way, but his methods may prove to be a double-edged sword.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He decides to put his new skill to good use by becoming a hero. However, he quickly becomes bored with easily defeating monsters, and wants someone to give him a challenge to bring back the spark of being a hero.\n\nUpon bearing witness to Saitama's amazing power, Genos, a cyborg, is determined to become Saitama's apprentice. During this time, Saitama realizes he is neither getting the recognition that he deserves nor known by the people due to him not being a part of the Hero Association. Wanting to boost his reputation, Saitama decides to have Genos register with him, in exchange for taking him in as a pupil. Together, the two begin working their way up toward becoming true heroes, hoping to find strong enemies and earn respect in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "The abandoned dormitory on the school's outskirts is haunted: the floors creak, creepy sounds fill the night's air, and only the bravest souls dare venture into this den of real-life ghosts. For Go Haejun, a second-year high school student who can see ghosts, it is the sole housing option after he misses the deadline to apply for a newer, safer dormitory. Things would not be so terrible if his only cohabitant were not a brazen and cheeky first-year student, Baek Eunyeong.\n\nEunyeong also happens to be the one responsible for destroying Haejun's plans by shamelessly stealing and wasting all of Haejun's savings. On top of that, he is sloppy, parties constantly, and lies as easily as he breathes. Haejun wrestles with unresolved guilt after fighting with his mother and running away, but he lacks patience for Eunyeong's childish acting out. No matter their vast differences and how much they hate each other, Haejun and Eunyeong are forced to coexist, as neither has another place to call home.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now burdened with the arduous task of rebuilding membership, he struggles to recruit anyone due to a lack of interest. Just as Kurata has lost nearly all hope in keeping the club alive, the feared delinquent Chika Kudou appears, claiming he will join and become the club president himself.\n\nAt first, Kurata refuses to admit such a troublesome person, aware of the dark rumors that have been circulating about Kudou. However, after discovering a more vulnerable side to Kudou and his mysterious connection to the club, Kurata rethinks his decision. The soon-to-be defunct club is saved with the help of koto prodigy Satowa Houzuki, who uses her charms to recruit Kudou's lively friends Saneyasu Adachi, Michitaka Sakai, and Kouta Mizuhara.\n\nWith sufficient numbers to retain the club's status, Houzuki declares that they will aim to become the best koto players in the nation, much to Kurata's dismay. This ragtag bunch of young musicians have a road filled with challenges and adversities ahead of them, and by overcoming their fears and differences, their aspirations may very well come true.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This is a far cry from reality, however, as Denji is forced by the yakuza into killing devils in order to pay off his crushing debts. Using his pet devil Pochita as a weapon, he is ready to do anything for a bit of cash.\n\nUnfortunately, he has outlived his usefulness and is murdered by a devil in contract with the yakuza. However, in an unexpected turn of events, Pochita merges with Denji's dead body and grants him the powers of a chainsaw devil. Now able to transform parts of his body into chainsaws, a revived Denji uses his new abilities to quickly and brutally dispatch his enemies. Catching the eye of the official devil hunters who arrive at the scene, he is offered work at the Public Safety Bureau as one of them. Now with the means to face even the toughest of enemies, Denji will stop at nothing to achieve his simple teenage dreams.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Mushi: the most basic forms of life in the world. They exist without any goals or purposes aside from simply \"being.\" They are beyond the shackles of the words good and evil. Mushi can exist in countless forms and are capable of mimicking things from the natural world such as plants, diseases, and even phenomena like rainbows.\n\nThis is, however, just a vague definition of these entities that inhabit the vibrant world, as to even call them a form of life would be an oversimplification. Detailed information on mushi is scarce because the majority of humans are unaware of their existence. So what are mushi and why do they exist? This is the question that a Mushishi, Ginko, ponders constantly. Mushishi are those who research mushi in hopes of understanding their place in the world's hierarchy of life.\n\nGinko relentlessly chases rumors of occurrences that could be tied to mushi, all for the sake of finding an answer. It could, after all, lead to the meaning of life itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He spends the days carefree with his friends at school, until the uneventful bliss suddenly comes to a halt with the transfer of the aloof beauty Aya Otonashi into his class and her cold, dramatic statement to him immediately upon arrival:\n\n\"I'm here to break you. This is the 13,118th time I've transferred. After so many occasions, I have to say that this is all starting to grate on me, which is why this time I'm spicing things up with a proper declaration of war.\"\n\nAnd with those puzzling words, the ordinary days that Kazuki loved so dearly become a cycle of turmoil and fear—Aya's sudden appearance signals the unraveling of unseen mysteries surrounding Kazuki's seemingly normal friends, including the discovery of mysterious devices known as \"boxes.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Inside the notebook, he finds a chilling message: those whose names are written in it shall die. Its nonsensical nature amuses Light; but when he tests its power by writing the name of a criminal in it, they suddenly meet their demise.\n\nRealizing the Death Note's vast potential, Light commences a series of nefarious murders under the pseudonym \"Kira,\" vowing to cleanse the world of corrupt individuals and create a perfect society where crime ceases to exist. However, the police quickly catch on, and they enlist the help of L—a mastermind detective—to uncover the culprit.\n\nDeath Note tells the thrilling tale of Light and L as they clash in a great battle-of-minds, one that will determine the future of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Hole—a dark, decrepit, and disorderly district where the strong prey on the weak and death is an ordinary occurrence—is all but befitting of the name given to it. A realm separated from law and ethics, it is a testing ground to the magic users who dominate it. As a race occupying the highest rungs of their society, the magic users think of the denizens of Hole as no more than insects. Murdered, mutilated, and made experiments without a second thought, the powerless Hole dwellers litter the halls of Hole's hospital on a daily basis.\n\nPossessing free access to and from the cesspool, and with little challenge to their authority, the magic users appear indomitable to most—aside for a few. Caiman, more reptile than man, is one such individual. He hunts them on a heedless quest for answers with only a trusted pair of bayonets and his immunity to magic. Cursed by his appearance and tormented by nightmares, magic users are his only clue to restoring his life to normal. With his biggest obstacle being his stomach, his female companion Nikaidou, who runs the restaurant Hungry Bug, is his greatest ally.\n\nSet in a gritty world of hellish design, Dorohedoro manages a healthy blend of comedy and lightheartedness with death and carnage. Taking plenty of twists and turns while following the lives of Hole's residents, it weaves a unique world of unearthly origin and dreary appearance not for the squeamish or easily disturbed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But to his dismay, like his deceased grandmother, Reiko, he possesses the ability to see \"youkai,\" or spirits. Natsume eventually discovers that Reiko had bequeathed to him a book of contracts in which she had bound youkai—the \"Book of Friends.\" However, without Reiko ever calling upon the spirits' names, they have been left in a confined state. Now, these spirits continuously pursue Natsume in the hopes of having their contracts dissolved for freedom.\n\nWhile there may be gentle, harmless spirits which come to Natsume for help, there are also malicious, hostile spirits that threaten him. This is where Madara steps in, a spirit disguised as a rotund cat. Commonly referred to as Nyanko-sensei by Natsume, Madara is a self-proclaimed bodyguard who has his own motives for accompanying Natsume.\n\nNatsume Yuujinchou is a supernatural slice-of-life series about a boy who struggles to live a normal life while balancing the spirit and human worlds and acquiring important life lessons along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To combat these vile beasts, ordinary people received superhuman powers and became known as \"Hunters.\" Twenty-year-old Sung Jin-Woo is one such Hunter, but he is known as the \"World's Weakest,\" owing to his pathetic power compared to even a measly E-Rank. Still, he hunts monsters tirelessly in low-rank Gates to pay for his mother's medical bills. \n\nHowever, this miserable lifestyle changes when Jin-Woo—believing himself to be the only one left to die in a mission gone terribly wrong—awakens in a hospital three days later to find a mysterious screen floating in front of him. This \"Quest Log\" demands that Jin-Woo completes an unrealistic and intense training program, or face an appropriate penalty. Initially reluctant to comply because of the quest's rigor, Jin-Woo soon finds that it may just transform him into one of the world's most fearsome Hunters. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But his life takes a turn for the worse when armed criminals come after his gang, killing them in the process. In an attempt to avenge his friends, Akutagawa finds himself on the verge of death. A mysterious man dressed in black greets him, saying that he will take care of his sister until Akutagawa is ready to challenge him again.\n\nMore than four years have passed, and there is still no sign of the man in black or Gin. Even so, Akutagawa refuses to give up on his search. When Sakunosuke Oda takes pity on his living conditions and invites him to become a member of the Armed Detective Agency, an opportunity arises for Akutagawa to finally get a lead on Gin's whereabouts.\n\nUnbeknownst to him, however, Gin is guarded by none other than Port Mafia's wicked leader, Osamu Dazai, and his successor, Atsushi Nakajima—the infamous \"White Reaper.\" To save his sister, Akutagawa must overcome his weakness and sacrifice it all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Neo-Tokyo, hastily built on the ruins of old Tokyo, is a sprawling cityscape of neon extravaganza. It is a fusion of towering skyscrapers and cutting-edge technology that is permeated through and through with an explosive, hyper-violent cocktail of biker gangs, poverty, and revolutionaries. In this derelict metropolis live Tetsuo Shima and Shoutarou Kaneda, two bikers who are the best of friends and the fiercest of rivals, despite being affiliated with the same gang. Desperate to prove himself as Kaneda's equal, Tetsuo unwittingly pulls a stunt that culminates in the awakening of a cryptic existence that threatens to change both the face of Neo-Tokyo and the lives of those who call the city their home—the awakening of a government secret simply known as Akira. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Akira won the 8th Kodansha Manga Award in the General category in 1984, the Harvey Award for Best American Edition of Foreign Material in 1993, and was nominated for the Harvey Award for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work in 2002. The series was published in English by Marvel Comics under the Epic Comics imprint as 38 fully colorized trade paperback volumes from 1988 to 1996. It was one of the first manga to be translated in its entirety. The publisher later collected into the series 10 volumes although incompletely. Dark Horse Comics republished Akira in its original six-volume format from December 13, 2000, to March 27, 2002. Kodansha Comics USA currently holds the license and republished the series from October 13, 2009, to April 12, 2011. The publisher later rereleased the series in a 35th-anniversary box set; the set contained six hardcover volumes in the original right-to-left reading format for the first time, as well as the artbook Akira Club. The manga was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora Globo based on Marvel Comics' release from December 1990 to March 1998.",

        "synopsis": "Becoming an ice dancer was not what Tsukasa Akeuraji had aimed for when he decided to take on the figure skating world. However, it is where he ended up, as he \"started too late\" to follow his true solo-skating dreams.\n\nFor years, he was content with being a shell of his former ambitions—that is, until he met a little girl in whom he saw himself. Inori Yuitsuka, a fifth-grader so desperate to skate that she practiced in secret, had visited Tsukasa's rink with her mother to ask for lessons. She was branded as useless by everyone around her, told it was \"too late\" for her to begin, and that catching up to other skaters was impossible.\n\nWith a newfound conviction and unwillingness to let another passionate skater go down the same road as him, Tsukasa takes on the responsibility of coaching her and promises to make Inori a medalist.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when Coco takes advantage of a golden chance to spy on the skilled witch Qifrey, she realizes that her favorite picture book was a disguised magic book all along! In her excitement, she immediately starts testing out the various spells.\n\nWhen a spell causes a disaster in her home, Qifrey rescues her just in time and decides to train her, realizing that she is the first lead he has found that could help him track down the Brimmed Caps—a dangerous group of heretics who experiment with forbidden body-altering magic and spread magical artifacts among the commoners. But before Coco and Qifrey can confront the Brimmed Caps, she is going to have to improve her magical skills and learn to get along with Qifrey's other apprentices.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She clings to them with the hope that she will one day experience a love story of her own—one that will sweep her off her feet and make her heart flutter. However, reality is often disappointing. When a classmate from junior high confesses his feelings to her, Yuu finds that she feels nothing. Unable to give him an answer, she becomes convinced that she is unable to fall in love.\n\nOne day, on her way to the student council room, Yuu encounters the council's president, Touko Nanami, turning down a confession from a boy. Inspired by Touko's confidence, Yuu turns to her for help. But when Touko becomes the next person to confess to Yuu, she is confused, yet her heart is set aflutter.\n\nYagate Kimi ni Naru is a manga about grappling with love and growing up. Will Yuu's long-awaited romance finally begin?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Suffering from a terminal illness, Yuuta's mother asks him to film her last moments, which he does. From her radiant smile when she is with her family to the times when sickness ravages her body in the hospital, he records hours upon hours of footage. After her passing, Yuuta compiles her life into a movie to screen at his school, deciding to add a bit of fantasy to the ending of his film, Dead Explosion Mother, with a literal explosion!\n\nFollowing the backlash caused by his supposedly tone-deaf portrayal of his mother's death, Yuuta trudges to the hospital roof to take his own life—but there, he meets a girl named Eri. Captivated by his film, Eri requests Yuuta to make a new  one that will blow the previous out of the water and prove his critics wrong. The movie they set out to make will stand apart by blurring the line between fact and fiction. And of course, it wouldn't be a Yuuta film if it didn't have his personal flavor—just a dash of fantasy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, however, she catches wind of the fact that the emperor's two infants have fallen gravely ill. She decides to secretly take action, drawing on her experience as a pharmacist raised in the poor red-light district.  \n\nDespite Maomao's attempts to remain anonymous, she soon catches the eye of Jinshi, an influential eunuch who recognizes her talents.

        "synopsis": "The self-conscious Shizuku Hoshikawa is on her way to dispose of her first and last novel. But before she can do so, the charismatic Kaori Asaka bumps into her and ends up taking the novel home. This turn of events greatly distresses Shizuku, as she does not want anyone to read the depressing story she wrote for her own satisfaction.\n\nInitially expecting the worst, Shizuku finds herself in tears of joy when Kaori tells her the novel deeply moved her. Kaori wishes to read more of her stories, but as Shizuku did not plan on writing anything else, she has no idea what to write. As a result, Kaori comes up with a bizarre suggestion—their love.\n\nShizuku is skeptical of Kaori's intention and somewhat uneasy about what secrets she may be hiding behind her smile. Nevertheless, the two begin their odd summer vacation in pursuit of their own love story.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Despite obtaining the title of student president at Taeyang High, he continues to study diligently, giving him little time to befriend others. However, possessing an exceptional talent for biking with a technique that astonishes other experienced bikers, there is more to him than meets the eye.\n\nOne afternoon, while Jay is skidding his bike at high speed, he catches the interest of his classmate, Yoon Min Woo. Amazed by his unparalleled biking skill, Min Woo is quick to recruit him to his biking crew, but Jay coldly rejects the offer. With a determination to show Jay the fun of riding with others, Min Woo proposes a simple deal—to race against a member of his team, promising to leave him alone if he wins.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Having lasted merely two weeks, World War III has come to an end. Both Accelerator and Hamazura Shiage have returned home to the people they cherish most after overcoming their individual conflicts. The world is at peace and Academy City continues on as normal while the magicians focus their efforts on repairing the damage they took from the war.\n\nAmong this tranquility, however, someone is missing. Someone who used his right hand to save a young girl while changing the tides of war along the way: the \"Imagine Breaker,\" Touma Kamijou. However, the disappearance of the self-proclaimed ordinary high school student has not affected the majority of the world as the temporary peace is soon broken when new threats, both espers and magicians, emerge across the globe. Now, the heroes of World War III must step forth into battle once more, facing off against some of the most powerful enemies imaginable in order to protect the people they hold most dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the far future, two young military leaders rise above their peers. The invincible genius Reinhard von Lohengramm is matched only by the unbeatable magician Yang Wen-li; though the two share a profound respect for each other, they meet on the battlefield not as comrades but as bitter adversaries. Commanding thousands of warships and millions of soldiers, they lead giant space fleets into battle on behalf of the two interstellar states that have wrested for control of the Milky Way for over a century and a half. \n\nThe Galactic Empire, an absolute monarchy ruled by Kaiser Friedrich von Goldenbaum IV and an entrenched nobility, seeks to suppress the rebels daring to oppose the inviolable crown. The Free Planets Alliance, a representative democracy led by a corrupt High Council, degenerates as its elected leaders⁠ use war and conflict as a way to win popular support. Reinhard is a minor noble who became a High Admiral through his strategic brilliance and his sister's position as the favored concubine of the Kaiser, while Yang is an avid historian and reluctant commodore hailed as a hero despite only using his tactical prowess to navigate around his leaders' incompetence. On opposite sides of the galaxy, the two men have wildly different visions for the future: Reinhard dreams of uniting mankind under his iron fist, while Yang wants only to carve a path to lasting peace. As the war rages on, Reinhard and Yang each strive for their ideals and secure their place among the stars as the leaders of a new era of galactic heroes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Dumbfounded by the offer presented to him, 27-year-old Arata Kaizaki hopes to turn his life around through a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.\n\nReturning home from his part-time job, Arata is persuaded by Ryou Yoake, an employee of ReLife Research Institute, into participating in an experiment which will help him overcome his difficulties and re-enter corporate life. As part of the ReLife experiment, Arata's physique is reverted to that of a 17-year-old, and all he must do is relive his high school life for one year. Waiting for him at the end of the experiment is a job offer that he has been struggling to get ever since he left his first company.\n\nWith few other options, he decides to go along with this plan. However, with adult-like tendencies and many years since his last formal education, Arata steps into an unexpectedly challenging territory—a normal day of high school.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sugimoto has been left to fend for himself after his release from the army for nearly killing a superior officer. Braving the rough terrain of Hokkaido, Sugimoto is now searching for gold in order to keep a promise to his lost brother-in-arms. His efforts have been fruitless for a long time until a mysterious traveler tells him of an urban legend that would rid him of all his troubles.\n\nAccording to the legend, a criminal stole the gold of the Ainu, the indigenous people of Hokkaido, and hid it away in a location that can only be found when a map—made not from pieces of parchment, but the tattooed skins of escaped convicts—is brought together.\n\nUpon meeting with a young Ainu girl, Asirpa, Sugimoto sets off in search of the tattooed prisoners, but many dangers await as soldiers and mercenaries seek the gold as well. Aided by Asirpa's knowledge of the lands, the two of them depart to find the stolen Ainu gold in a journey of revenge, murder, and greed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It is said that, as a practitioner of demonic cultivation, he raised the dead to wage war against the great cultivation sects. The true name of the Yiling Patriarch is Wei Ying, courtesy name Wuxian, and he has returned from the dead, summoned into the body of a mad man!\n\nWhen Wei Wuxian reawakens, he finds himself in Mo Village, which is owned by a branch family of one of the great sects. No sooner does he have time to get his bearings before his world is thrown into disarray again—by a dismembered arm leaking an immense amount of demonic energy. However, the origin of the limb is only the first mystery. Shortly after, the ever-stoic Lan Wangji—someone whom Wei Wuxian believes to harbor great animosity toward him—arrives to sweep Wei Wuxian off his feet!\n\nAs Wei Wuxian and Lan Wangji seek to unravel the mystery behind the demonic arm, they face both enemies and friends of old, and its link to Wei Wuxian's downfall all those years ago.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Though once the Shogunate's chief executioner, his name is left in ruins after being framed for treason by the treacherous Yagyuu Clan, seeking to steal his position of power. His misfortune does not end here, however; they culminate in the brutal murder of his entire family, including his wife Azami, with only his child Daigorou still left alive.\n\nWith dishonor upon his head and his beloved wife in the grave, Ittou takes up a new mantle as an assassin for hire. Alongside his young son, Ittou wanders the country in search of revenge, with only the complete destruction of the Yagyuu Clan on his mind. As he travels the land, the number of his successful assassinations quickly grows, and soon the moniker of \"Lone Wolf and Cub\" becomes infamous across the land as the choice assassin to get the job done right.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Kozure Ookami was published in English as Lone Wolf & Cub initially by First Comics in 1987 as a monthly comic book-sized series featuring cover illustrations by many renowned comic book artists such as Frank Miller. Each issue contained around 64 to 128 pages, but publication was canceled at 45 issues after the company's shutdown in 1991. Dark Horse began republishing the series in traditional tankoubon format from September 12, 2000, to December 24, 2002; as well as in 2-in-1 omnibus volumes from May 22, 2013, to April 26, 2016. In 2001, Dark Horse's edition won the Eisner Award for the Best U.S. Edition of International Material. The manga was also published in Brazilian Portuguese by Panini Comics from December 2004 to April 2007. The series has been adapted into multiple live-action films, television series, and stage plays.",

Despite the samurai's attempts to combat the extraterrestrial menace, the Shogun soon realizes that their efforts are futile and decides to surrender. This marks the beginning of an uneasy agreement between the Shogunate and Amanto, one that results in a countrywide sword ban and the disappearance of the samurai spirit.\n\nHowever, there exists one eccentric individual who wields a wooden sword and refuses to let his samurai status die. Now that his kind is no longer needed, Gintoki Sakata performs various odd jobs around town in order to make ends meet. Joined by his self-proclaimed disciple Shinpachi Shimura, the fearsome alien Kagura, and a giant dog named Sadaharu, they run the business known as Yorozuya, often getting caught up in all sorts of crazy and hilarious shenanigans.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Dandelion\nVolume 2: Shirokuro (Black and White)\nVolume 24: 13\nVolume 38: Bankara-san ga Tooru",

        "synopsis": "In the distant future, humanity has terraformed Mars into an oceanic planet to suit their needs. Now known as Aqua, the planet serves as a new home for people discontent with living on Manhome—the planet formerly known as Earth. Being a perfect imitation of Manhome's Venice, the town of Neo-Venezia has inherited all of the rustic charms of the original. Gondolas weave their way through the waterways of the dreamy town while nostalgic alleys await those who travel on foot.\n\nAkari Mizunashi, a young Manhome native, has recently made Neo-Venezia her new home. To pursue her dream of becoming a gondolier tour guide—or Undine—Akari joins the Aria Company, one of the most renowned water guide companies in town. As she basks in a simple lifestyle unavailable on Manhome, Akari cheerily ambles through her daily life in Neo-Venezia: the town where magic and miracles abound.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Yggdrasil is a virtual reality game renowned for the freedom it offers its players. After a simple tutorial, players are left to explore the world and can customize anything and everything, from their classes to their weapons. However, in the year 2138, the game sees its final hours as its servers shut down at midnight.\n\nMomonga, a devoted player of Yggdrasil, decides to spend the game's last hours inside his guild, Ainz Ooal Gown. Strangely, at the stroke of midnight, the game does not log him out. Instead, Momonga finds himself transported to another world, one that is seemingly identical to that of Yggdrasil. Facing an already abnormal situation, he discovers that the NPCs have gained sentience.\n\nTrapped in his avatar's skeletal body and desperate to uncover the cause of his predicament and find other players like him, Momonga sets out to take control of the new world with the help of his loyal subjects.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Shigeo \"Mob\" Kageyama is an eighth-grade student blessed with extraordinary psychic powers. However, Mob decides to suppress his abilities in public due to its destructive and conspicuous nature. To keep his psychic powers honed, he works under Arataka Reigen—a self-proclaimed esper looking to make use of Mob's skills.\n\nAlongside Reigen, Mob spends his days exorcising evil spirits at Reigen's behest. With the simple wish to impress his childhood friend Tsubomi Takane, Mob works toward making himself more desirable. But troubles keep on bombarding his daily life, slowly breaking his shackled feelings. With his repressed emotions welling up, there's no telling what will happen once he reaches his limit.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She turns out to be Mai Sakurajima, a famous former actress and fellow student at Minegahara High. His surprise at seeing Mai wear such risqué attire in the library, however, is nothing compared to the shocking realization that he is the only one who can see her!\n\nReminded of an event from his past, Sakuta offers to help Mai discover the reason behind her invisibility. Despite their initially contentious relationship, the two quickly become close: Mai and Sakuta learn to appreciate each other, and their friendship turns into a budding romance. This further fuels their determination to solve Mai's dilemma.\n\nWhile the investigation progresses, Sakuta attributes Mai's situation to an urban legend known as Adolescence Syndrome: strange phenomena occurring in youth, unexplained by science and often dismissed as delusion. With few promising results, Mai's predicament worsens to the point where being unseen is the least of her worries. Can Sakuta and Mai solve the mystery of her Adolescence Syndrome before she disappears completely?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He studies well and plays around with his friends, but in truth, he does not enjoy either of those activities. Bound by norms, he secretly envies those who do things differently.\n\nThat is until he discovers the joy of drawing. When he sees a painting made by a member of the Art Club, Yatora becomes fascinated with the colors used in it. Later, in an art exercise, he tries to convey his language without words but instead through painting. After that experience, Yatora finds himself so invested in art that he decides that it is what he wants to do for a living. But there stand multiple obstacles in his way: his parents who are hesitant over his unique choices, his more experienced peers, and the study of a subject much deeper than he initially expected.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Having recently moved from her small backwater town in Ishikawa Prefecture to attend a prestigious high school in Tokyo, Mitsumi Iwakura plans on using her high school career as a launchpad for her dream of going to law school and becoming a public servant; however, she also recognizes the need to occasionally have fun and make friends. To that end, she has gone so far as to map out her entire life ahead of time, but all of her preparation flies out the window on the first day of school.\n\nMitsumi misses her train stop and is about to be late to the entrance ceremony, which is especially troublesome because she is supposed to give a speech as the new students' representative. While lamenting her situation, Sousuke Shima—a handsome first-year student who is also late—sees her and offers to walk with her  to school. They eventually make it to school, although Mitsumi has some unfortunate accidents soon after that leave a less-than-favorable impression on everyone. In spite of her misfortune, her classmates soon take notice of Mitsumi and Sousuke's chemistry, despite their differing personas.\n\nWith the new year already off to an interesting start, Mitsumi is eager to get to know her classmates better and get involved at her school. Only time will tell if this country bumpkin can make it in the city, but one thing has become certain: she definitely will not be alone on her journey!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On his way home, Kazuma dies trying to save a girl from an oncoming truck—or so he believes. In reality, the \"truck\" was a slow-moving tractor, and he merely died from shock.\n\nWaking up in limbo between death and heaven, Kazuma finds himself facing the arrogant goddess Aqua. Here, he must choose between two options: go on to heaven or be sent to a fantasy world that needs his help to defeat the Demon King. Initially unimpressed by the challenging prospect of fighting a Demon King, Kazuma changes his mind after Aqua tells him he can bring any one item he wants. What better choice does Kazuma have than the goddess standing before him?\n\nUnfortunately, after the two arrive in their new world, two things become clear: Aqua is useless beyond belief, and life in this fantasy realm will be anything but smooth sailing. From paying for food and accommodations to trying to learn new skills, the duo's problems are just starting to take shape—and the arrival of eccentric allies may only make things worse.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

For over a decade, he has lived vicariously through Yoo Joonghyuk, the main character of the web novel Three Ways to Survive the Apocalypse (TWSA). Through Joonghyuk, Dokja has experienced secondhand the trials of repeatedly regressing in time, in search of an end to life-threatening \"scenarios\" that force people to act out narratives for the amusement of god-like \"Constellations.\"\n\nAfter reading 3,149 chapters—long after all other readers lost interest—Dokja finally resigns himself to the story ending. However, he receives an enigmatic message from the author, stating that the story will soon be monetized, before his surroundings suddenly go dark. He swiftly realizes that fiction has become reality and he is now living through TWSA. Although he is the singular omniscient reader of the events yet to come, his success in the scenarios is not guaranteed—but perhaps his advantage will empower him to step into the protagonist role that never suited him before.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, the world of gambling is neither welcoming nor forgiving, and some will lie and cheat to win. Therefore, a powerful organization, \"Kakerou,\" exists to ensure that all bets maintain a semblance of fairness.\n\nBaku Madarame, often referred to as \"Usogui,\" is a genius gambler willing to bet more than just money. Putting his life on the line, he faces off against psychotic opponents in deadly psychological games. With his cold and calculating nature and high level of intellect, Baku challenges the liars known as gamblers while aiming to seize control over Kakerou itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolumes 12–15: Igyou Tobakusha Usokui\nVolume 25: Yakou-san",

Since childhood, he had been in the care of Dino \"Papa\" Golzine, the mafia boss who turned him into the ruthless killer he is now. At first, Ash was just a pretty face for Golzine's pleasure, but now estranged from him, a 17-year-old Ash runs his own gang with an iron fist.\n\nEiji Okumura is a young Japanese photographer. Traveling to New York as an assistant, Eiji is set to work on a report about kids living in the streets. There, he meets teenage gang leader Ash and is mesmerized by the boy—who in turn is curious about Eiji's different lifestyle.\n\nBut this is the dark underground of New York, and recently a series of murders has surfaced in the city, connected only by the words \"Banana Fish.\" With personal stakes in this mysterious battle, it is up to Ash, Eiji and their allies to discover what exactly \"Banana Fish\" is, where it came from and how to get rid of it—before the world as they know it descends into chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He earned the title of \"Human Metronome\" for performing almost perfectly. Every musician of his age looked up to him. However, after his mother suddenly dies, he became tone-deaf due to the shock and then disappeared, never to be seen onstage since.\n\nTwo years later, Kousei lives a monotonous life with his childhood friends Tsubaki Sawabe and Ryouta Watari supporting him. He continues to cling to music, although performing is still an impossibility for him. This is until his unexpected encounter with Kaori Miyazono, a violinist who performs freely without the dictations of a score. A story of friendship, love, music, and a single lie, Kousei's life begins to change and gain color as Kaori helps him to take up music again.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now, twenty years later, Toranosuke is bedridden in a hospital, but still, their love perseveres. Together, the infatuated couple reminisce about days gone by—when he proposed, when they first met, their relationships with those around them, and their blissful married life. \n\nThough Toranosuke has always been a bit hard-headed and Kaoru a bit short-tempered, their immense love is shown in the wrinkles on their aged skin and in the unbridled devotion in their eyes. It is so strong that they know they will love each other with the same devotion... even in their next life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They discover that because of the world's imperfections, it is actually a thing of beauty. \"The world is not beautiful, therefore it is.\"\n\n(Source: Tokyopop)",

In contrast, Cheol's new seatmate, Hwang Mi-ae, is incredibly outgoing and the shortest in their class. They look comical next to each other, and to add to their embarrassment, their names are the same as those of a famous but extremely ridiculous dancing duo.\n\nCheol struggles with controlling his temper and avoids others by any means necessary, while all Mi-ae is interested in are comics, her favorite boy band, and going out with her friends. However, he is her new neighbor, and they even knew each other in early childhood. Despite everyone's fear of Cheol, Mi-ae notices his awkwardness and selfless nature and tries to befriend him. He may be difficult to approach for now, but through the busy days of studying for the high school entrance exams, Cheol will soon become Mi-ae's most precious person.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Only minutes after he arrives does he accomplish his first goal; however, Joutarou finds that Jousuke is not only a much younger high school student, but he possesses a Stand of his own called Crazy Diamond. Not long after their meeting, the two make a startling discovery: someone is using a supernatural bow and arrow to create Stand users around Morioh.\n\nWhen Jousuke witnesses the threat that this poses, he resolves to protect his town and stop the spread of lethal Stand users. Finding both allies and enemies among these users, Jousuke learns just how much one's personal interests and ambitions can be reflected in their Stands, and the resulting harm or virtue it brings. As they continue to investigate, they begin to unearth the shocking history of Morioh, bringing forth hidden dangers and a mystery from years past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In contrast to her, Taichi Mashima, the son of a surgeon, is gifted yet insecure as he is burdened by the heavy expectations of his strict mother, who wants him to be perfect in everything. However, the lives of Chihaya and Taichi soon change as they encounter Arata Wataya, the new transfer student in their class.\n\nInspired by Arata's dream to become the best at competitive karuta—a card game based on the classic anthology of one hundred Japanese poets—Chihaya quickly falls in love with the game. Refusing to lose to the talented Arata, the prideful Taichi joins along and immerses himself in the game, aiming to one day surpass his fated rival. The three friends spend their childhood practicing karuta everyday, until certain circumstances force them to part with each other.\n\nA few years later, now in high school, the trio finds themselves reunited through the world of competitive karuta. Alongside their newfound comrades and rivals, they embark on a journey of self-discovery, friendship, and romance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The impact melted the continental ice mass and drastically raised sea levels, damaging the world's climate and causing the deaths of over half its population. Now in 2015, devastating creatures of unknown origin—referred to as Angels—ravage what remains of the planet.\n\nIn the heavily fortified city of Tokyo-3, 14-year-old Shinji Ikari is destined to halt the Angels' onslaught. Recruited by his father's secret organization, NERV, Shinji is enlisted as a pilot of an Evangelion, a massive bioorganic android created solely to defeat the Angels.\n\nSuddenly with the weight of the world upon his shoulders, Shinji must find the courage and drive to stand up for the future—and himself. But as skirmishes between the Evangelions and Angels become recurrent, the horrifying truth of the world is slowly revealed.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After concluding his latest assignment, the number of people he has recently killed becomes too high, and Fable is ordered by his boss to lay low for a year. He is suggested that having to adapt to life as an ordinary citizen might prove a valuable experience for his future work.\n\nFable is to be accompanied by the woman who acts as his driver, and the two will assume new identities as siblings. However, their boss warns them that they will both face a deadly punishment if Fable kills anyone during his time off. Thus begins Akira and Youko Satou's joint one-year sabbatical from the underworld.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Reminiscent of a broken toy box, the mystical Abyss is a terrifying realm home to monstrous creatures called Chains. Most believe it to be only a fairy tale, used to scare children who misbehave. Oz Vessalius, the cheerful and mischievous heir of the noble Vessalius family, is one such individual—until, at his coming-of-age ceremony, the mysterious Baskerville Clan arrives and condemns him to the Abyss for a sin he neither committed nor knows anything about. Oz then forms a contract with Alice, a unique Chain who can take on human form, in an attempt to escape from the Abyss.\n\nAs Oz struggles to unravel the mysteries behind his sin, the Abyss, and a tragedy from one hundred years ago, he and his companions find themselves confronted by the Baskervilles and ghosts from the past. Meanwhile, his journey back home is plagued by relentless despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 8: Pandora Hearts (pilot)",

People lead simple lives along the Silk Road, believing in various customs and traditions as they have for many years. Amir Halgal is a beautiful 20-year-old woman skilled in archery, hunting, and horseback riding. She has come from a faraway village for an arranged marriage to a charming 12-year-old boy by the name of Karluk Eihon.\n\nDue to the large age difference, the relationship between Amir and Karluk is a little awkward initially. However, everyday interactions between the two allow them to develop feelings of love and respect for each other that eventually strengthen their bond. Otoyomegatari follows the daily lives and challenges of Amir and Karluk alongside various other couples across Central Asia, in a beautiful portrayal of the culture and traditions of the brides of the era.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "A teenage girl, who possesses the \"Mystic Eyes of Death Perception,\" a supernatural ability that allows the user to see the \"death\" of everything in existence and kill the object by destroying its \"origin.\" She recently recovered from a two-year coma caused by a traffic accident. Prior to the traffic accident, she originally had two personalities, a male personality named Shiki (織), and the original female personality Shiki (式). Children born into the Ryougi family are generally male and are raised with two personalities, so the male personality is customarily called the \"yang\" personality, while the female is called the \"yin\" personality. It is easy to tell which Shiki is speaking at a given time because they both have a distinct style of speaking, most notably that the female Shiki refers to herself with the pronoun watashi (私), while male Shiki refers to himself as ore (俺). After waking from her coma, Shiki discovers that she can no longer feel the male Shiki's presence and assumes that he died because of the accident. She also feels a detachment from her memories before the accident, and while she knows she is Shiki, she does not feel that she is. In the hopes of regaining herself and the \"dead\" Shiki, she puts on a cold facade that somewhat resembles the male Shiki's and tries to act as the female Shiki did. Touko understands the sense of detachment Shiki feels, but considers the current Shiki a third, new personality.\n\nThe series is regarded as being set in the same world as another TYPE-MOON series, Tsukihime, with Aoko Aozaki's sister Touko Aozaki being featured in this series and the protagonist of the series, Shiki Ryougi, possessing the same abilities as Tsukihime's protagonist, Shiki Tohno.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

        "synopsis": "From time immemorial to the age of space colonization, there is one legend that has stayed unchanged in every history book—the tale of the immortal bird Phoenix. A being whose blood is said to grant eternal life or wisdom, the radiant figure ensures the continuation of sentient life in the universe as it oversees human civilizations and their development.\n\nYet, mankind remains a slave to its habits; from happiness and sorrow, to wrath and love, a myriad of emotions continue to play an integral part of human life. Simultaneously, time and time again, certain beliefs and agendas persist over the centuries to disturb the fragile equilibrium of the world's preordained nature and principles. It appears that fate, with its dynamic variables, can manifest itself in many ways—and oftentimes exhibits a bizarre sense of humor.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: This is an incomplete series due to Tezuka's death.",
        "background": "Hi no Tori was published over the course of 21 years from 1967 to 1988, but was left incomplete due to Tezuka's death in 1989. The first seven chapters were serialized by COM magazine between 1967 to 1971; the remaining chapters were published by Manga Shounen and Yasei Jidai. Hi no Tori was published in English as Phoenix in 11 volumes by VIZ Media under the VIZ Signature imprint from March 12, 2003, to September 18, 2007. Previous to this, it had had a brief run in the educational publication Mangajin, from May to July, 1992 (issues #17 - #19). A live-action film following the Dawn storyline directed by Kon Ichikawa was released on August 12, 1978, in Japan and on March 30, 1979, in the United States.",

But after finding out that Shou considers her as little more than a mere housekeeper, she swears to enact revenge by entering the entertainment industry herself and beating him at his own game!\n\nHowever, Kyouko's revenge plan suffers a setback almost immediately when she is rejected by the talent agency of her choice. Fortunately, the president of the agency gives her a second chance, and places her in the newly made \"Love Me\" section. Kyouko then begins her long journey to stardom, cultivating her skills as an actress and forming relationships with new friends along the way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Hundreds of years ago, horrifying creatures which resembled humans appeared. These mindless, towering giants, called Titans, proved to be an existential threat, as they preyed on whatever humans they could find in order to satisfy a seemingly unending appetite. Unable to effectively combat the Titans, mankind was forced to barricade themselves within large walls surrounding what may very well be humanity's last safe haven in the world.\n\nIn the present day, life within the walls has finally found peace, since the residents have not dealt with Titans for many years. Eren Yeager, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert are three young children who dream of experiencing all that the world has to offer, having grown up hearing stories of the wonders beyond the walls. But when the state of tranquility is suddenly shattered by the attack of a massive 60-meter Titan, they quickly learn just how cruel the world can be. On that day, Eren makes a promise to himself that he will do whatever it takes to eradicate every single Titan off the face of the Earth, with the hope that one day, humanity will once again be able to live outside the walls without fear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

First-year high school student Nene Yashiro daringly summons Hanako-san in desperate need of love, but the Hanako that appears before her is a boy!\n\nAfter Hanako-kun claims that he has no magical items of use, Nene tries various ways to get noticed by her crush. With her desperation reaching its peak, she gets into trouble after consuming a mermaid scale, which turns her into a fish. Hanako-kun rescues her, binding their fates together in the process; in return for this aid, Nene must become his assistant. Now entangled in the supernatural realm, Nene soon discovers that there's much more to the school's Seven Mysteries than basic rumors.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Toua Tokuchi, a master of gambling and mind games, holds the remarkable record of 499 wins and zero losses in \"One Outs,\" a simplified form of baseball that consists of only a batter and a pitcher. Visiting Okinawa, Tokuchi's hometown, is Hiromichi Kojima, the star batter of the Saikyou Saitama Lycaons, the weakest team in the Japanese baseball league. Dreaming of leading the Lycaons to winning the championship, and in dire need of a replacement for their injured pitcher during a training camp, Kojima involves himself in a game of One Outs, only to lose to a normal fastball from the seemingly invincible Tokuchi.\n\nMesmerized by his prowess, Kojima recruits Tokuchi to the team after narrowly avoiding defeat in a rematch, believing he might just be their key to victory. However, the greedy owner of the Lycaons refuses to give him a decent salary, leading Tokuchi to suggest an unusual contract: every out he pitches will gain him five million yen, but every run he gives up will lose him fifty million yen. With his fate now tied to that of the team, Tokuchi's fight to bring the Lycaons to victory becomes yet another gamble—the very thing that he does best.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As customary per year, the entire family is gathering on the island for a conference that discusses the current financial situations of each respective person. Because of the family head's poor health, this year involves the topic of the head of the family's inheritance and how it will be distributed.\n\nHowever, the family is unaware that the distribution of his wealth is the least of Ushiromiya Kinzou's (family head) concerns for this year's family conference. After being told that his end was approaching by his longtime friend and physician, Kinzou is desperate to meet his life's true love one last time: the Golden Witch, Beatrice. Having immersed himself in black magic for many of the later years in his life, Kinzou instigates a ceremony to revive his beloved upon his family's arrival on Rokkenjima. Soon after, a violent typhoon traps the family on the island and a string of mysterious murders commence, forcing the eighteen people on the island to fight for their lives in a deadly struggle between fantasy and reality.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Her father had evaded his enormous gambling debts by escaping town, which resulted in his daughter being evicted by the debt collectors. As Nanami muses about her future, she runs into a man hanging onto a tree to escape a dog. She rescues him and tells him about her current situation, prompting the man to offer her his home. He believes that Nanami is more suited than him to be the \"Master\" of the house, and thus she takes him up on his offer.\n\nUpon arrival, however, Nanami discovers that said house is actually a dilapidated shrine. She is about to double back when a fox familiar and two shrine spirits stop her, mistaking her for their former master Mikage, the land god of the shrine. Upon realization, Tomoe—the fox familiar—leaves the shrine, refusing to serve Nanami. After a series of events leaves Nanami in grave danger, she summons Tomoe and seals a contract with him to earn his subservience. Now a human land god, Nanami must face new daunting tasks, menacing adversaries, and her handsome and hot-headed familiar.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But as his series becomes a massive hit, Kevin discovers that his famed character, Billy Bat, already existed before within a Japanese comic.

        "synopsis": "Ten years have passed since the end of Bakumatsu, an era of war that saw the uprising of citizens against the Tokugawa shogunate. The revolutionaries wanted to create a time of peace, and a thriving country free from oppression. The new age of Meiji has come, but peace has not yet been achieved. Swords are banned but people are still murdered in the streets. Orphans of war veterans are left with nowhere to go, while the government seems content to just line their pockets with money.\n\nOne wandering samurai, Kenshin Himura, still works to make sure the values he fought for are worth the lives spent to bring about the new era. Once known as Hitokiri Battousai, he was feared as the most ruthless killer of all the revolutionaries. Now haunted by guilt, Kenshin has sworn never to kill again in atonement for the lives he took, and he may never know peace until killing is a thing of the past.\n\nNow in the 11th year of Meiji, Kenshin stumbles upon Kaoru Kamiya, owner and head instructor of a small dojo being threatened to close its doors. The police force is powerless to stop the string of murders done in the name of her dojo by a man claiming to be the famous Battousai. Kenshin's wanderings pause for now as he joins Kaoru to clear both their names. But how long can he stay before his past catches up to him?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Meteor Strike",

        "synopsis": "Yoshikazu Miyano is a meek high school student who enjoys reading boys-love manga. One day, he finds himself in a predicament of stopping a fierce school fight, unsure of what actions to take. Before everything gets worse, he is interrupted by upperclassman Shuumei Sasaki, who boldly takes his place and saves Miyano from his grief. From that day on, Miyano has quietly looked up to him.\n\nHowever, three months later, Miyano realizes that Sasaki is more bothersome than admirable. At school, Miyano is greeted by him with playful teases, not to mention the frequent friendly skinship he receives. When Sasaki asks for manga recommendations, Miyano lets him borrow a boys-love comic he owns. Surprisingly, Sasaki ended up enjoying its content and got hooked on boys-love as well, marking the start of a shared passion. Could it develop into something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

He likes visiting Hanae Wada most, a grumpy yet kind elderly woman whom Hiroto calls \"Granny.\" Hiroto's time with Granny is sadly cut short when she passes away from a heart attack. To his surprise, Hiroto inherits Granny's house as she never married or had children.\n\nThree months later, 18-year-old Natsumi Kobayashi moves from her hometown to attend art school. With nowhere else to go, she stays with her cousin Hiroto, whom she has not seen in years. Despite their opposing personalities, the pair begin living under the same roof as they struggle through their seemingly mundane lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when the girl sitting behind him stands up to give her speech, the words she utters dumbfound the entire class. Proclaiming that she has no interest in ordinary humans and is in search of the supernatural, Haruhi Suzumiya makes her unforgettable debut.\n\nDoubting Haruhi's sincerity, Kyon lets his curiosity get the better of him and attempts to befriend her in spite of his classmates' warnings. Unfortunately, as the eccentric girl slowly opens up to him, Kyon realizes she is dead serious. Moreover, a conversation between the two sparks a dangerous idea in Haruhi's mind: since she is bored with the mundanity of the school's clubs, she should just create her own. With this, the SOS Brigade is born, and Kyon is quickly dragged into a life of absurdity.\n\nTaking over the Literary Club's room, Haruhi soon enlists three new members into her organization: the stoic Yuki Nagato, the timid Mikuru Asahina, and the supposedly mysterious transfer student Itsuki Koizumi. Having thrown together this group of students, Haruhi drags the squad around on adventures in search of the exciting and supernatural, much to Kyon's chagrin. However, he soon discovers that there is more to the new recruits than meets the eye, and that which Haruhi wishes for may be much closer than she realizes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As she is drawn further into the mysterious world of the Soumas, she meets more of the family, forging friendships along the way.\n\nBut this curse has caused much suffering; it has broken many Soumas.

An organization known as the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG) has been established in response to the constant attacks on citizens and as a means of purging these creatures. However, the problem lies in identifying ghouls as they disguise themselves as humans, living amongst the masses so that hunting prey will be easier. Ken Kaneki, an unsuspecting university freshman, finds himself caught in a world between humans and ghouls when his date turns out to be a ghoul after his flesh.\n\nBarely surviving this encounter after being taken to a hospital, he discovers that he has turned into a half-ghoul as a result of the surgery he received. Unable to satisfy his intense craving for human meat through conventional means, Kaneki is taken in by friendly ghouls who run a coffee shop in order to help him with his transition. As he begins what he thinks will be a peaceful new life, little does he know that he is about to find himself at the center of a war between his new comrades and the forces of the CCG, and that his new existence has caught the attention of ghouls all over Tokyo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Willem Kmetsch wakes up from his icy slumber as the last surviving Emnetwiht, a race of humans that populated the planet’s surface until they met their untimely demise five centuries ago at the hands of \"Beasts.\" Currently, he lives among the hundred odd floating islands that make up civilization—otherwise inhabited by various other species, all of whom possess distinct animal-like features such as horns, fangs, wings, and scales. Because he lacks any such feature, Willem is referred to as a \"markless.\"\n \nOne day, Willem encounters another markless named Ctholly Nota Seniorious. He thinks nothing of the meeting, and continues to spend his days working odd jobs until he runs into her again, this time after accepting a military posting.  Willem soon learns that the group of bubbly young Leprechauns he is tasked to look after are pivotal in the ongoing battle against the Beasts. These girls, who have had little exposure outside a world where they are treated as weapons, are willing to die if it means defeating the Beasts.\n\nDetermined to nurture a life of normalcy for them, Willem soon becomes a father figure to the girls. Just like how he once went off to battle, he must now come to terms with watching these children go off to war.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Beatrice's drastic departure from her defiant motives urges him to question every circumstance in the previous four games. Despite wanting to stay by her side, Battler resolves to regain control of the current situation, where Lambdadelta and Frederica Bernkastel have temporarily taken their places to play the fifth game board.\n\nWith the passing of Kinzou Ushiromiya, Krauss Ushiromiya succeeds the family headship amid deep financial troubles. Due to poor investment choices, the family inheritance is set to fall into the hands of Krauss' benefactors, allowing his siblings to easily take legal action against him. In order to assist her husband, Natsuhi Ushiromiya enlists Beatrice's help to revive the former head—hoping to conceal the truth until the debts are paid.\n\nEnter Erika Furudo: a self-proclaimed detective who washes up on the island of Rokkenjima at the start of the family's annual conference. Welcomed as an honored guest, Erika quickly takes an interest in the ongoing discussion about the riddle of the epitaph. The pompous girl's tenacious investigation into finding the hidden gold, however, sparks a chain of events that threatens to collapse the order of the Ushiromiya family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The demon gives them an elixir of immortality and the method of ending their existence by \"devouring\" one another. Soon after, one among them begins to devour his companions. Realizing the danger posed by staying together, they scatter across the globe.\n\nCenturies later in 1930's America, a certain federal investigator tries his best to combat the rise of organized crime during Prohibition, send a particularly infuriating terrorist to Alcatraz, and catch an outrageous thief duo. Meanwhile, the transcontinental train, the Flying Pussyfoot, begins its trail of blood across the country.\n\nIn 2002, a small group of the original Advenna Avis alchemists are on a journey to find the rest of their fellow immortals. However, there is one companion they did not expect to meet again.\n\nSeemingly unrelated events, from a sleepy Italian city in the early 1700's to a modern luxury cruise ship traveling across the Pacific, reveal themselves to be far more connected than anyone could imagine...\n\n(Source: Wikipedia, MAL Rewrite)",

The battle almost saw the end of the Ten Great Sects of ancient China, when Cheongmyeong ended the hard-fought struggle by striking down Cheonma. Soon after, he succumbed to his wounds, filled with regret at their pyrrhic victory. All is not lost, however, as he awakens to his second chance at life. Shocked to find his beloved Mount Hua Sect reduced to a mere shadow of itself in the present day, Cheongmyeong embarks on a journey to restore Mount Hua to its former glory.\n\n(Source: Webtoon Entertainment)",

Sajou, studious and reserved, is yet to be accustomed to such strong feelings for Kusakabe, making him overthink and insecure. In contrast, Kusakabe, straightforward and bold, does not restrain himself from showing intimate affection.\n\nWhile Kusakabe reveals his dream to one day become a professional musician, Sajou is tirelessly preparing for college. Their differing goals bring an unspoken, heavy cloud over their relationship: as the boys approach their graduation, it is unclear what awaits their romance. Nevertheless, their love warms them in the coldest winter and brings hope that, eventually, they will find the answer to their uncertain future together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a traumatic event she experienced as a teenager, Juri has attempted suicide three times and has come to hate her mother. With her life clouded due to a dark past, her aunt Monica, a member of the clergy, invites her to visit a convict sentenced to death.\n\nYuu is a death row inmate charged with murdering three people, leading to many attempts at ending his own life within his jail cell. He frequently receives letters from Monica, who hopes to help him, but sees this as an act of pity. But when Yuu decides to meet Monica to say that he wants her to stop sending letters, he encounters Juri, a meeting that would change both of their lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, she is far from having the motivation or skills to realize these hopes. When a friend introduces her to an unorthodox, backstreet art class taught by the strong-armed Kenzou Hidaka, called simply as \"sensei,\" Akiko decides to enroll, expecting an easy ride and an automatic improvement in her art skills. To her chagrin, what she gets is something else entirely—a tough, demanding, and uncompromising teacher with absolutely no interest in manga.\n\nBut when Akiko takes up Sensei's challenge of an intense schedule, she comes to recognize how much he cares about his students and forms a close bond with him. With Sensei's guidance, Akiko learns what is necessary to become a successful mangaka as well as what it means to be an adult.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "There is a tune stuck in Mafuyu Satou's head. As he clutches the guitar in his hands, this melody swirls around and around, screaming words of regret, longing, and loss. But with his careless expression that always seems to be up in the clouds, no one knows his true feelings. However, a chance encounter with classmate Ritsuka Uenoyama may finally give Mafuyu the push to let his voice be heard.\n\nUenoyama is the guitarist of a band, whose fellow members include the kindhearted bassist Haruki Nakayama and rough-looking drummer Akihiko Kaji. Even without a vocalist, their ragtag group has done well as an instrumental-only band. However, their chance to reach even greater heights may have arrived when Uenoyama hears Mafuyu's voice—Uenoyama is enchanted, inviting the reluctant Mafuyu to join.\n\nWorking in a band is a difficult task; often, emotions threaten to break it apart, but they can also bring its members closer together. With Uenoyama's help, Mafuyu may finally be able to express the feelings that fight to break free from within his heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Within the club's room, six beautiful, bored boys spend their time entertaining equally beautiful and bored girls.\n\nHaruhi Fujioka, a poor scholarship student, has no interest in the Host Club—until she breaks a valuable vase in their clubroom. After being mistaken for a boy, Haruhi is forced by Kyouya Ootori to work for the Host Club to repay her debt. Tamaki Suou, the princely leader of the club, eagerly takes her under his wing to teach her the ways of the host.\n\nThings, however, are never quite so simple with the Host Club around. Even the most mundane events can turn into huge spectacles with the likes of prankster twins Hikaru and Kaoru Hitachiin, stoic Takashi Morinozuka, and sweet Mitsukuni \"Hunny\" Haninozuka. The crazy adventures of the Host Club are just beginning, and Haruhi must learn how to survive in the glitzy world of the hosts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nNote: The final volume contains a special bonus chapter where the group travels to Spain.",

        "synopsis": "Constantly transferring schools since childhood, Kaoru Nishimi has always been seen as a social outcast when he transfers due to his intellectual nature and wealthy background. But after moving to Kyushu for his first year of high school, things begin to change when Kaoru befriends the class president Ritsuko Mukae and, unexpectedly, the notorious school delinquent Sentarou Kawabuchi. While Kaoru is an honors student, Sentarou is constantly getting into fights and skipping class. However, these two opposites find a common ground in one thing—music.\n\nOne day, Kaoru is invited by Ritsuko to visit her family's record store, where he finds Sentarou in the basement showcasing his skill in jazz drumming. Kaoru, being a classical pianist, knows nothing about jazz. But inspired by the performance, he begins to open his mind to the genre alongside Sentarou. The duo begin to practice in after-school jazz sessions in the record store's basement. As he spends more time improving his skills in jazz, Kaoru finds a person whom he can truly call his friend, and comes to learn the joys of playing music. Sakamichi no Apollon follows their story of friendship and love brought together by jazz.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "When Griffith realizes that he will no longer be able to actualize his dream in his debilitated state, he wishes upon his Crimson Behelit as a final resort. Doing so triggers the \"Eclipse\"—a ritual in which the invoker sacrifices something of significance in exchange for great power. Griffith ultimately chooses to offer his legion of devoted followers, the Band of the Hawk.\n\nSubsequently, Griffith transcends to the Abyss where he faces an enormous entity akin to God. The being introduces itself as the Idea of Evil. Coveted into existence by humanity's collective subconsciousness, it has gone on to manipulate the lives of humans throughout all world events.\n\nAs Griffith now exists as a part of the human consciousness, present in the Abyss, the Idea of Evil eerily declares \"Your desire is my desire... May your actions bring pain or salvation to mankind. Do as you will, Chosen One.\" With that, Griffith harvests the pain of his comrades to transform into his ideal self.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With no food and nowhere to go, all hope seems lost—until he saves a mysterious man called Osamu Dazai from drowning. Much to his partner Doppo Kunikida's irritation, Dazai offers Atsushi a meal and reveals they work for the Armed Detective Agency, an organization of gifted individuals who take care of criminal cases the authorities cannot.\n\nThe two ask Atsushi for his assistance in tracking down a supernatural tiger that has been wreaking havoc throughout the city, and he reluctantly agrees. After they resolve the case, Dazai offers him a position in the agency. But the job is about to get a lot more dangerous as the Port Mafia, the local crime syndicate, begins to move against them. Caught in the middle of a turf war, Atsushi must master his newfound special ability in order to protect himself, his new friends, and the entire city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he possesses the exceptional talent to dodge punches, Yu prefers to let his perpetrators beat him down as he finds no meaning in his survival.\n\nThings begin to look up when Yu meets an old boxing trainer nicknamed \"K.\" Having raised five champions, K's years of experience and an impressive gut feeling allow him to recognize Yu's near-superhuman fighting charisma immediately. K rushes to take Yu under his wing, despite the latter's apparent lack of interest.\n\nHowever, after being reminded of a bright memory from the past, Yu has a change of heart and accepts K's offer, hoping to experience the same light once again. Thus, Yu enters a world full of formidable adversaries—righteous and monstrous alike—and for the first time ever, he has no choice but to fight back.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "For the agent known as \"Twilight,\" no order is too tall if it is for the sake of peace. Operating as Westalis' master spy, Twilight works tirelessly to prevent extremists from sparking a war with neighboring country Ostania. For his latest mission, he must investigate Ostanian politician Donovan Desmond by infiltrating his son's school: the prestigious Eden Academy. Thus, the agent faces the most difficult task of his career: get married, have a child, and play family.\n\nTwilight, or \"Loid Forger,\" quickly adopts the unassuming orphan Anya to play the role of a six-year-old daughter and prospective Eden Academy student. For a wife, he comes across Yor Briar, an absent-minded office worker who needs a pretend partner of her own to impress her friends. However, Loid is not the only one with a hidden nature. Yor moonlights as the lethal assassin \"Thorn Princess.\" For her, marrying Loid creates the perfect cover. Meanwhile, Anya is not the ordinary girl she appears to be; she is an esper, the product of secret experiments that allow her to read minds. Although she uncovers their true identities, Anya is thrilled that her new parents are cool secret agents! She would never tell them, of course. That would ruin the fun.\n\nUnder the guise of \"The Forgers,\" the spy, the assassin, and the esper must act as a family while carrying out their own agendas. Although these liars and misfits are only playing parts, they soon find that family is about far more than blood relations.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She has lived in the same place her whole life, and rarely interacts with others save for her best friend, Rin Fujishiro.

Unlike most, Itsuomi is unwavering when he learns of Yuki's impairment; this, along with his experiences abroad, fascinates and touches her. After they part, her fondness of him starts to grow. A new world begins to open for both Yuki and Itsuomi as they learn about each other's different lives.\n\nYubisaki to Renren is a lighthearted, romantic comedy that illustrates the silent life of a university student and how one man sharing his world starts to change her own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, a girl with a scar on her forehead named Kouko Ishigami, accompanied by a ghost of a tall and friendly man, transfers into his class.\n\nFuuta quickly takes a liking to Kouko, wondering if it might be love at first sight. After waking up crying from a strange dream involving her, he feels a nostalgic connection to Kouko and becomes determined to befriend her. However, a chain of events forces Fuuta to reveal his birthmark to Kouko, to which she declares him to be the enemy of her life. A furious Kouko explains that the two are bound by reincarnation, and that Fuuta's birthmark is a curse she engraved on him in one of their past lives to recognize and eventually defeat him.\n \nKouko brings out a circular object made of flames known as the \"spirit circle\" and attacks Fuuta, pushing him off a flight of stairs. As he falls, Fuuta is thrown back into the insight of one of his previous lives. Spirit Circle chronicles Fuuta's journey back and forth his several past lives as he gradually unravels the mysteries behind his apparent bad blood with Kouko.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, this is not the source of Jin's insurmountable terror: the thing that he fears more than anything else is his own father.\n\nTo most, Jin's father is a successful businessman, good samaritan, and doting parent. But that is merely a facade; in truth, he is a deranged serial killer—and Jin is his unwilling accomplice. For years, they have been carrying out this ruse with the police being none the wiser. However, when his father takes an interest in the pretty transfer student Yoon Kyun, Jin must make a decision—be the coward who sends her to the gallows like all the rest, or be the bastard of a son who defies his wicked parent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "After reflecting on the current state of Japanese soccer, the Japanese Football Association decides to hire the enigmatic and eccentric coach Jinpachi Ego to achieve their dream of winning the World Cup. Believing that Japan has lacked an egoistic striker hungry for goals, Jinpachi initiates the Blue Lock—a prison-like facility where three hundred talented strikers from high schools all over Japan are isolated and pitted against each other. The sole survivor of Blue Lock will earn the right to become the national team's striker, and those who are defeated shall be banned from joining the team forever. \n\nSelected to join this risky project is Yoichi Isagi, a striker who failed to bring his high school soccer team to the national tournament. After choosing to pass to a teammate who missed instead of scoring on his own, he could not help but wonder if the results would have been different had he been more selfish. Using this golden opportunity given by the Blue Lock Project, Yoichi aims to clear his doubts and chase his ultimate desire—to become the greatest striker in the world and lead Japan to World Cup glory.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

By achieving good grades, participating in various extracurricular activities, and demonstrating model etiquette, she thought her life was going exactly as planned. However, after receiving a romantic confession from a girl in her swim class, Sayaka realizes how emotions can defy her logical, straightforward thinking.\n\nWanting to cooperate rather than compete with peers at the start of middle school, Sayaka's shift in perspective leads her to befriend her senior Chie Yuzuki. As the two form a gentle bond, Yuzuki confesses her feelings to Sayaka, who reciprocates her affection in hopes of learning the significance of love. Despite sacrificing her devotion to academics, their relationship ends, leaving Sayaka scarred with resentment.\n\nSwearing to never let her feelings take control of her life again, Sayaka vows to revive her independence in high school. But when class representative Touko Nanami captures her eye, Sayaka must settle her struggle between accepting her genuine self or pursuing her logical way of life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the novel The Lovely Princess, the secondary character Athanasia de Alger Obelia is the most pitiful of all. Her mother died in childbirth and her father, Emperor Claude, never gave his daughter even an inch of love. Forever yearning for even the slightest bit of parental love, she was ultimately framed for a crime and executed by the orders of her beloved father.\n\nWhen a woman from modern-day Korea falls asleep with some sleeping pills, she later awakens in the infant body of Athanasia. Knowing the unenviable fate that awaits her, she resolves to remain out of her tyrannical father's sight so that she may never incur his wrath. However, fate isn't so kind, and she meets him at only five years of age. With her original plan tossed out of the window, she now aims to endear herself so much to her father that he would never dream to hurt her.\n\nHowever, as many work toward their own ends, her plan is thrown into chaos—Athanasia's biological \"sister\" Jennette Margarita longs for a family, high-ranking nobility vie for power, and a shadow from Claude's past threatens to destroy everything he holds dear.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The stranger is quickly given a name, Jousuke, and Joushuu's father Norisuke decides to adopt him into the Higashikata household until he can find his own home.\n\nAs Jousuke begins to investigate his past, it becomes apparent that he is no ordinary amnesiac. There is much more to his identity than he first suspected, and, as he is thrust into a series of high-stakes Stand battles, he soon begins unravelling a deadly conspiracy that encompasses the entire town.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Deep in the back of the mansion lies a garden and a lone building, where the mysterious daughter of the house, Shizu Karasawa, lives in isolation.\n\nWhile cleaning near the building, Tetsu chances upon the enigmatic girl, and when he returns the next day, they quickly get to know each other. Shizu reveals to him that she is confined to the building due to an unknown illness afflicting her, and that she has had no human interaction for years.\n\nAs they continue to meet, Tetsu's feelings toward Shizu develop—but when he realizes how he truly feels, he is faced with the true nature of her illness. Ohayou, Ibarahime follows Tetsu as he searches for the real Shizu underneath her supernatural condition—both for her sake and the sake of his own feelings.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, when she looks at herself in the mirror, she discovers two shimeji mushrooms growing on the top of her head. This odd occurrence, combined with a lack of social ability and being bullied in middle school, leads Shijima to keep to herself when she arrives at school.\n\nWhile reading alone, Shijima is approached by her classmate, Majime Yamashita, an eccentric girl with a fried egg on her head. Majime pesters Shijima to be her friend, giving her the nickname \"Shimeji\" upon seeing the mushrooms growing on her head. After enough insistence on friendship, Shimeji gives in and decides to keep Majime company. Shimeji tries to get through a less-than-normal high school life as she explores the mysteries and wonders of this strange world with her new tenacious companion.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Kou Kitamura is a fifth grader whose family runs a sporting goods store. One of the regular customers of his family's store is the Tsukishima Batting Center, and so he gets to know the four daughters of the Tsukishima family (Ichiyo, Wakaba, Aoba, and Momiji) very well. Since Kou has spent so much time practicing in their batting cages, he has become a genius hitter, but has no knowledge of any other aspect of baseball. This is in contrast to Aoba, who, despite being a year younger, is an adept pitcher and hitter. Wakaba is a classmate of Kou's, and she seems fully intent on marrying him when she grows up. All seems idyllic in their world, until tragedy strikes. The story then skips ahead to four years later, as Kou has continued the training he began four years ago, but has not played in a baseball game since. As he finally begins playing again, it remains to be seen whether or not he will live up to the expectations of those who know the true talent he has been hiding all this time.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

Eventually, his duty leads him to meet Li Huan, a new student with a fairly oppressive height. Besides his intimidating physique, he is taciturn, aloof, and often gives Yu Yang the cold shoulder.\n\nYu Yang, who has done nothing but assist him, immediately grows frustrated by this treatment. However, despite his initial impressions, Yu Yang believes that his chance encounter with Li Huan will transform his future outlook—perhaps even on the prospect of love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, Mahiru Shiina, the \"Angel\" of Amane's school and his neighbor, instead gives him a lot more than that. Instead of just the umbrella, she insists on returning the favor by helping him recover from his cold. However, she is oblivious to the battlefield that is Amane's apartment.\n\nThe only word Mahiru finds from her mouth to describe the chaos is \"unsightly.\" But despite her unsympathetic description, Mahiru proceeds to help the hopeless Amane. Otonari no Tenshi-sama ni Itsunomanika Dame Ningen ni Sareteita Ken follows Amane as he is taken care of by Mahiru, who attends to various chores—from cleaning his apartment to cooking dinner. Is there anything that the Angel can not do?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Afraid and alone, he created the Book of Vanitas, a cursed grimoire that would one day take his vengeance on all vampires; this is how the story goes, at least.\n\nVanitas no Karte follows Noé Archiviste, a young man who is traveling aboard an airship in 19th-century Paris with one goal in mind: to find the Book of Vanitas. A sudden vampire attack leads him to meet the enigmatic Vanitas, a doctor who specializes in vampires and, much to Noé's surprise, an entirely ordinary human. The mysterious doctor has inherited both the name and the infamous text from the Vanitas of legend, using the grimoire to heal his patients. But behind his kind demeanor lies something a bit more sinister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Saved by her rash kindness, the occult-obsessed boy attempts to speak to her about supernatural interests he believes they share. Rejecting his claims, Ayase proclaimed that she instead is a believer in ghosts, starting an argument between the two over which is real.\n\nIn a bet to determine who is correct, the two decide to separately visit locations associated with both the occult and the supernatural—Ayase visiting the former and the boy visiting the latter. When the two reach their respective places, it turns out that neither was wrong and that both the occult and ghosts do exist.\n\nThis marks the beginning of Ayase and the boy's adventure, as they attempt to fix the surreal, supernatural, and occult elements around them to return to a normal life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kusakabe works tirelessly while pursuing his music career, leaving him with little time to visit Sajou. Meanwhile, Sajou involves himself more with extracurricular activities and drinking with his college friends.\n\nHowever, Kusakabe's absence weighs heavily on Sajou, and when Kusakabe visits unannounced one day, Sajou breaks off their engagement. Although the love between them never waned, both Kusakabe and Sajou now have to navigate through their new normal and hope that, eventually, they will find their way back to each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

An unusual group of friendly people gathers there, each with their own stories to tell.\n\nTasuku Kaname is a troubled high school student who is prepared to commit suicide because his classmates found out that he might be gay. As he questions his existence, the sight of a mysterious woman jumping off a nearby building leaves him utterly startled. He rushes to the scene only to discover her unharmed, soon learning that she is the owner of the aforementioned building, known to everyone as Anonymous.\n\nAnonymous notices Tasuku's nervous temperament and offers him an ear if he is willing to share his problems. While speaking to her, he realizes that the most painful thing is his inability to accept his sexuality. Emotional and heartfelt, Shimanami Tasogare is a realistic take on the struggles of Tasuku among other lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people in coming to terms with their selves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In his opinion, real life is an awful game; three-dimensional girls are annoying and false representations of how a real girl should be.\n\nOne afternoon, while taking a break from cleaning duty, he stumbles across a strange message that goads him to conquer a girl. On a whim, he accepts, and his consent summons a girl named Elucia \"Elsie\" de Lute Ima, a denizen of hell tasked with capturing runaway spirits that have festered in girls' hearts. Keima is shocked and tries to escape, but Elsie tells him that failure to fulfill the newly formed contract will result in the termination of his life!\n\nTasked with capturing the runaway spirits, Keima uses his expertise and knowledge of dating sims to obtain the hearts of girls in real life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When he angers a group of delinquents by refusing to act as their errand boy, he makes an incredibly speedy getaway, an ability he has developed through years of running from his tormentors.\n\nYouichi Hiruma—the demonic captain of the Deimon Devil Bats football team—happens to be nearby, and seeing Sena's \"golden legs\" at work, forcibly recruits him as a running back despite Sena's desire to be team manager instead. Made to don the number 21 jersey and a special helmet to hide his identity as a player, Sena becomes \"Eyeshield 21,\" the team's closely guarded secret weapon. Soon he realizes his love for the sport, and aims to help the Devil Bats reach the Christmas Bowl, the high school football championship.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sid wants to be someone just like that more than anything, and something as insignificant as boring reality isn't going to get in his way! He trains in secret every single night, preparing for his eventual rise to power—only to denied his destiny by a run-of-the-mill (yet deadly) traffic accident. But when he wakes up in a another world and suddenly finds himself at the head of an actual secret organization doing battle with evil in the shadows, he'll finally get a chance to act out all of his delusional fantasies!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

Due to the strict class stratification, the average citizen has little chance of successfully rising up to the top, where the despicable nobility rules over them all.\n\nWilliam James Moriarty, the second son of the Moriarty household, is a young mathematics professor who has displayed great cunning and intellect since he was a child. Along with his brothers Albert and Louis, he lives the simple life of a noble. Outside of school, William is a well-known private consultant willing to solve the problems of anyone in need. However, his gentle demeanor belies his position as the head of a group prepared to wreak havoc in pursuit of its desire—a new world built from the ashes of the old.\n\nYuukoku no Moriarty puts a new spin on Arthur Conan Doyle's original work by putting the spotlight on its main antagonist and exploring how he came to be the first and only \"criminal consultant.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, however, Lawrence's adventure takes an unexpected turn when he discovers a naked wolf girl asleep in his wagon.\n\nThe charming girl claims to be Holo, the wolf deity of the nearby town Pasloe. Having grown weary of the ungrateful locals, she requests Lawrence to take her back to her hometown of Yoitsu, located farther north. In return, she will help him with his mercantile affairs, lending him her shrewd mind and keen judgement.\n\nThe pair now travels from town to town, dealing with various people and the troubles they come with.

The duo seems to have quite a bit in common on the surface. Both of them aspire to emerge as delinquents upon entering their new school, and they begin to wear obnoxious haircuts to make them stand out from other teenagers.\n\nHowever, despite being a feared pair, these two students actually have more differences than similarities. Itou wants to use his fists to protect the weak, earning respect and admiration from his classmates. On the other hand, Mitsuhashi strives to be the strongest in Japan—striking fear in anyone watching him.\n\nRegardless of these dissimilarities, the two are notorious for their remarkable fighting abilities, and their friendship thrives when they come together to throw fists. Whether it be a fight against the good or the bad guys, nobody can win against these two unusual delinquents.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Bulma, a headstrong 16-year-old girl, is on a quest to find the mythical Dragon Balls—seven scattered magic orbs that grant the finder a single wish. She has but one desire in mind: a perfect boyfriend. On her journey, Bulma stumbles upon Gokuu Son, a powerful orphan who has only ever known one human besides her. Gokuu possesses one of the Dragon Balls, it being a memento from his late grandfather. In exchange for it, Bulma invites Gokuu to be a companion in her travels.\n\nBy Bulma's side, Gokuu discovers a world completely alien to him. Powerful enemies embark on their own pursuits of the Dragon Balls, pushing Gokuu beyond his limits in order to protect Bulma and their growing circle of allies. However, Gokuu has secrets unbeknownst to even himself; the incredible strength within him stems from a mysterious source, one that threatens the many people he grows to hold dear.\n\nAs his prowess in martial arts flourishes, Gokuu attracts stronger opponents whose villainous plans could collapse beneath his might. He undertakes the endless venture of combat training to defend his loved ones and the fate of the planet itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Dragon Ball has become one of the most successful manga series of all time. With over 260 million copies sold worldwide, the series is the fourth best-selling manga of all time as of 2024. It is often credited for the \"Golden Age of Jump,\" where the magazine's circulation was at its highest. The series was serialized in English by VIZ Media in a monthly comic book anthology format from March 1998 to March 2005. The publisher later collected the series into traditional tankoubon volumes from March 12, 2003, to June 6, 2006. To closely follow the English anime localization, the series was split, with volumes 17 through 42 titled Dragon Ball Z and renumbered as volumes 1 through 26. Other releases by VIZ Media include the large format VIZ Big Edition, kanzenban cover-based 3-in-1 edition, and a full-color edition of chapters 195 through 245. The series was also published in Spanish by Planet DeAgostini Cómics; in German and Danish by Carlsen Verlag; and in French and Dutch by Glénat Editions.",

Ever since the trendy Aya stumbled upon a small CD store to enjoy the rock classics her friends are not familiar with, the mysterious employee behind the counter has been on her mind. Meanwhile, the quiet and aloof Mitsuki Koga listens to her popular classmate Aya rave about her crush, tormented by a nagging thought: how to tell Aya that the guy she is interested in is not a guy at all!\n\nIn reality, when Mitsuki sheds her plain high school uniform, she is the one manning the counter at her uncle Joe's CD shop. She wrestles with how to reveal her identity, but flirting with the stunning and clueless Aya is just too tempting. As music becomes their shared passion, it seems that Aya's feelings will remain unchanged—even when Mitsuki's secret comes to light.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Confessing to your crush is no easy task for any teenager, and it is no different for Chiyo Sakura, who was saved from being late on the first day of school at Roman Academy by Umetarou Nozaki. Touched by his action, Sakura begins to develop feelings toward him.\n\nOne fateful day in their second year of high school, Sakura finally musters up the courage to confess. Swallowing her fears, she reveals it to him in a classroom after school. However, unbeknownst to her, Nozaki is actually a praised shoujo manga artist working under the pen name of \"Sakiko Yumeno.\" His work is acclaimed for being sensitive toward girls' feelings, but Nozaki himself has no experience with love or being in a relationship.\n\nAll this results in him misunderstanding Sakura's confession as nothing but praise from a fan, and he simply hands her his autograph. One misunderstanding leads to another, and she somehow ends up working as an assistant for his manga. Gekkan Shoujo Nozaki-kun follows Sakura as she continually tries to convey her feelings to the oblivious Nozaki while helping him with his manga, as well as meeting his quirky assistants who coincidentally also attend Roman Academy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There, the laws of nature are governed by the Way—a moral code established by the Mandate of Heaven—that causes kingdoms to be ravaged by war and famine when an unsuitable ruler is upon the throne. Babies are born from eggs on trees, and mythical creatures roam the land.\n\nWhen a temporary breach is created between that world and Japan, Youko Nakajima is dragged from her mundane daily life as a high school student and finds herself in a situation far less appealing than that of a fairytale. Once a model student who always conformed to societal pressures, she is now abandoned and pursued by men and beasts alike in the wilds of a land unbound by any earthly sense of order. Struggling to come to terms with these strange new laws as well as the lack of kindness in the people around her, Youko must learn to make her own choices if she is to survive with any sense of integrity.\n\nFantastical and heavily detailed, Juuni Kokuki tells the stories of Youko and other individuals forced to find themselves as they are thrust into an unforgiving and coldly beautiful world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, he is extremely narcissistic about his work, and when a senior curator dismisses his award-winning piece as conventional and bland, he loses his cool, leading to potentially career-ending repercussions. \n\nAfter seeing his son's immaturity, his father⁠—also a master calligrapher—sends Handa to a village in the Goto Islands as punishment. Deprived of city comforts, Handa moves into a house in the local village with the sole intention of spending his stay engrossed in calligraphy. However, the house he has moved into was previously the hideout for some rambunctious children, headed by Naru Kotoishi, who are unwilling to move out. Furthermore, the neighbors seem very interested in the calligrapher, who they see as an amusing oddity!\n\nDespite Handa having been uprooted from his comfortable lifestyle, his experiences with the village and its people will teach him things about himself, life, and calligraphy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She clears the normal mode in no time and finds herself pitying the villainess, Penelope Eckhart. Penelope is a fake―a replacement for the duke's missing daughter, the protagonist of the game.\n\nInitially confident about clearing the hard mode as well, the woman is shocked by the sheer leap in the level of difficulty, eventually passing out from exhaustion. However, when she wakes up, she no longer recognizes her surroundings, for she has been reincarnated into the body of the villainess!\n\nIn a world where everyone seems to be out for her blood, Penelope must make wise decisions that keep her away from the death route.

        "synopsis": "The internet is home to countless urban legends, but the most prominent is the mysterious gamer known only as \"Blank.\" Behind breaking records in hundreds of games, Blank is just two shut-in NEET siblings: the manipulative 18-year-old Sora and the 11-year-old detached genius, Shiro. Together, they are an unbeatable duo with zero losses to their name.\n\nOne day, the siblings receive an anonymous email challenging them to a chess game. Upon securing a flawless win, they are immediately summoned into a colorful alternate world. A playful boy named Tet, who introduces himself as the \"One True God,\" tells them that the world of Disboard has a unique system for resolving disputes—any and all disagreements are resolved through simple games. Furthermore, of the 16 races inhabiting the realm, humanity is ranked the lowest and least powerful, barely scraping by with a kingdom consisting of a single city.\n\nIn a world that has yet to see war or bloodshed in centuries, Sora and Shiro quickly make a name for themselves as they set their eyes on an ambitious goal: to defeat Tet with their gaming wits and conquer this new world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "There is a strange rumor surrounding the Urashima Tunnel: it grants the wish of those who enter at the cost of their lifespan. Kaoru Touno did not think much of this silly urban legend until he stumbled across a dark tunnel one night.\n\nInitially dismissing the idea of going in, Kaoru is enticed by the possibility of bringing back his sister, Karen. Karen had died in an accident five years prior as a result of Kaoru's carelessness. As he enters the tunnel, what Kaoru discovers within is not quite the same as the rumors imply. The rules of the tunnel are uncertain, but that does not stop him from testing the waters.\n\nUnbeknownst to Kaoru, his aloof classmate Anzu Hanashiro follows him on one of his expeditions. Much to his reluctance, she is intrigued by the tunnel and wants to team up with him. Although he is wary of her intentions, Kaoru accepts Anzu's offer and spends the summer with her in hopes of reviving his sister.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Once the two get talking, it seems that the visitor (Calling himself Endou) is a debt collector. The reason for his visit is an unpaid loan which Kaiji had previously co-signed for a work-mate (Furuhata Takeshi). The original loan was 30000 yen and once Takeshi had disappeared, the loan then fell on Kaiji.\n\nKaiji is then told of a way to clear the interest compounded debt (which stood at 3,850,000 yen), which involved getting on a boat with others in his position. Once on the boat the debtors would then have to gamble with loaned money, which would end with a few winning, and others getting into deeper debt and having to work to pay of their debts. After some coercing kaiji accepts a position on the boat, in order to clear himself and make a bit of money as well...\n\n(Source: AniDB)",

        "synopsis": "Throughout civilization, books have been revered. They crystallize knowledge, link the past to the future, and convey thought itself. To protect all sorts of written texts, a man known as the Magus of the Library established the Central Library in Aftzaak—the City of Books.\n\nIn the slums of the desert village Amun lives Theo Fumis, a young boy who loves to read. Unfortunately, people from the slums are unable to use the local library. To make matters worse, he is continually bullied by his peers due to his unusually long ears. Seeking to escape from his miserable living conditions, he dreams of one day going to Aftzaak.\n\nHis unpleasant daily life is soon interrupted by the arrival of the Kafna—elite librarians skillful enough to work at the Central Library. Sedona Bleu, one of the Kafna, lends Theo her most cherished book; however, due to unforeseen circumstances, he is unable to finish reading it by the time the Kafna have to depart. Fortunately for Theo, Sedona renews his loan, giving him yet another reason to go to the City of Books.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After a tragedy leaves the Earl and his wife dead, many are shocked when their son, a young boy named Ciel, claims his place as the new Earl of the Phantomhive house. At first, many perceive him only as a child surrounded by a few eccentric servants. But they soon begin to realize that it is foolish to meddle with Ciel and his demonic butler Sebastian.\n\nTaking place at the end of the 19th century, Kuroshitsuji follows these two as they face countless mysteries and dangers that plague England and threaten the Queen, uncovering the truth about what really happened to Ciel's parents in the process.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

From this, the rumored ghost of the club came to life.\n\nGrumpy insomniac Ganta Nakami stumbles across the moderately rebellious yet easygoing Isaki Magari in the Astronomy Club's abandoned observatory. Magari is jolted awake and tries to escape from the scene, only to have a broken door prevent that, forcing the two inside. The two forge an unlikely friendship, leading them to use the observatory as a safe space for them to interact.\n\nKimi wa Houkago Insomnia follows the insomniacs Nakami and Magari's time in the starlit observatory as they help each other cope with insomnia and the lasting effects it has on student life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, she is asked by her teacher to turn over one of her manga slots in the school newspaper to a truant student named Kyomoto. When Kyomoto's manga pops up alongside Fujino's, it receives high praise for its detailed artwork, making Fujino furiously jealous.\n\nRefusing to be beaten by someone who barely attends school, Fujino devotes herself to learning to create manga. As time goes on though, her goal of outshining Kyomoto seems to only get further and further away; and Fujino, now in sixth grade, eventually gives up and quits making manga.\n\nGraduation day arrives, and Fujino is asked to deliver Kyomoto's graduation certificate to her. Through chance, the two end up coming face to face, and their unexpected meeting will end up having consequences far beyond what either of them could ever predict.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the present day, the emperor and his four sons reign over the country with an iron fist. It is said that only the prophesied \"Child of Destiny\" can free Japan from the royal family's shackles.\n\nSarasa is the twin sister of Tatara, the Child of Destiny. Despite having to live in her brother's shadow, Sarasa supports him in any way she can. However, tragedy strikes when the Red King, the emperor's youngest son, and his army attack her village, leading to Tatara's brutal death. To protect the townspeople, Sarasa takes on her brother's name and becomes the Child of Destiny, vowing revenge on the Red King.\n\nWith the sudden turn of events taking a toll on her health, Sarasa visits a hot spring to recuperate. During her stay, she meets Shuri, a charming yet mysterious young man.

        "synopsis": "Manji is an infamous swordsman in feudal Japan who is known as the \"Hundred Man Killer,\" as he has killed one hundred innocent men. However, there is something far more frightening than his ominous reputation: the fact that he is immortal. This is the handiwork of eight-hundred-year-old nun Yaobikuni, who placed bloodworms capable of healing almost any wound in Manji's body. \n\nTo atone for his crimes, Manji resolves to kill one thousand evil men. Yaobikuni agrees to this proposal, saying that if he succeeds, she will undo his curse of immortality. Soon after this promise, Manji meets Rin Asano, a 16-year-old girl who requests Manji's assistance in killing those who slaughtered her parents.\n\nInitially reluctant, Manji refuses Rin's desperate plea. However, owing to her evident lack of strength, Manji changes his mind and agrees to protect Rin for four years. With this partnership set in stone, the two embark on a perilous journey of bloodshed, vengeance, and redemption, each to fulfill their own life's cause.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Mugen no Juunin won the Excellence Prize at the first Japan Media Arts Festival in 1997. The series was published in English by Dark Horse Comics as Blade of the Immortal in monthly comics issues from June 1, 1996, to November 14, 2007, but was stopped after 131 issues. The publisher also released the manga in 31 volumes from March 1, 1997, to April 1, 2015. The release featured the unusual method of cutting out and rearranging panels, which was done so to have the series read left to right while still appealing to Hiroaki Samura's request of not flipping the pages. Dark Horse Comics republished the series in 3-in-1 omnibus volumes, with the final omnibus containing Shousetsu Mugen no Juunin: Ninjuu Ibun. The first 19 volumes were released in Brazilian Portuguese by Conrad Editora from February 2004 to February 2007; the full series was published by Editora JBC in 2-in-1 omnibus volumes from December 2015 to May 2018.",

With her parents often away from home due to work, Hori has to look after her younger brother and do the housework, leaving no chance to socialize away from school.\n\nMeanwhile, Izumi Miyamura is seen as a brooding, glasses-wearing otaku. However, in reality, he is a gentle person inept at studying. Furthermore, he has nine piercings hidden behind his long hair and a tattoo along his back and left shoulder.\n\nBy sheer chance, Hori and Miyamura cross paths outside of school—neither looking as the other expects. These seemingly polar opposites become friends, sharing with each other a side they have never shown to anyone else.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But behind her cute facade lies the soul of a ruthless salaryman who challenged \"Being X\"—the self-proclaimed God who reincarnated the man into an industrial world of magic. By doing this, Being X hopes to prove that, if the situation were dire enough, even a non-believer like this man would pray for God's help.\n\nOpposing Being X's desires to make her suffer, Tanya enlists in the military with the hope of living a peaceful life. She manages to impress the higher-ups with her aptitude for war, swiftly rising through the ranks. However, her country soon participates in the ongoing world war, quickly crushing her dream. In an attempt to return to her calm she starts using any merciless means to obliterate her opponents. Thus begins the saga of Tanya the Evil and the Empire as they seek world domination.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Using erotic thoughts of his female classmates as stimulus, he locks himself daily in a seldom-used girl's bathroom at school to do his dirty deed.\n\nOne day during class, Kurosawa witnesses the popular girls bullying the timid Aya Kitahara. Although not one to be riled over such matters, he decides to deliver retribution with his own hands. In a daring move, he steals the uniforms of the bullies and dispenses his \"white justice\" over them.\n\nAlthough satisfied with his exploits, Kurosawa's troubles are only just beginning. While going about his daily routine, he is suddenly confronted by Kitahara, who identifies him as the culprit behind the uniform incident, and blackmails him into terrorizing the other girls in the class the same way he dealt with her bullies. Left with little choice, Kurosawa agrees, and thus begins a coming-of-age story that deals with consequences, bullying, and people's ability to change.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Shinichi Chiaki, the perfectionist son of a famous pianist, is in his fourth year at Momogaoka College of Music, hoping to achieve his secret dream of being a conductor. His admiration for his father led him to pursue a career in music. As much as he wants to return to Europe, his phobia of flying traps him in Japan where he now lives.\n\nOne night, he passes out, and ends up being taken in by Megumi \"Nodame\" Noda. Upon first glance, Nodame is a talented pianist, but she is also slobbish and eccentric. What's even worse is that she is his neighbor and he ends up forced to work with her. Though it sounds like a recipe for disaster, Chiaki is drawn to this girl who makes him remember the love for music he once held. Just what does the future hold for this musical duo?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Yi \"Shioon\" Shi-Woon's everyday life at Nine Dragons High School—which consists of beatings from fellow student Ho Chang and his gang—is far from ideal. But one day, a mysterious man named Han Chun Woo spots one of these beatings and instead of offering support, brands Shioon a coward for refusing to fight back, adding insult to injury. To Shioon's surprise, he finds out that Chun Woo is the new substitute English teacher at his school.\n\nTired of the daily abuse, Shioon decides to enroll at a martial arts academy to learn how to defend himself. On the way there, he stumbles upon Chun Woo in a predicament—cornered in an alley by a group of angry men! Provoked, Chun Woo suddenly dispatches them using martial arts techniques, which Shioon covertly records. Later, he uses this recording to blackmail Chun Woo into teaching him to defend himself. Reluctantly, Chun Woo agrees, and Shioon is soon thrust into the world of martial arts, known as Murim. However, Shioon is naive and unaware of his master's shady past and the unseen underbelly of society. How will Chun Woo manage to teach Shioon and help him survive in the world of Murim?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Its residents awaken something akin to a supernatural ability inside them, which is then ranked from Level 0 to 5. Along the lines lies Touma Kamijou, a powerless Level 0 esper. While his abilities are recognized as useless, he possesses a mysterious phenomenon known as \"Imagine Breaker,\" which allows his right hand to nullify any supernatural powers upon coming in contact with them. Despite that, he claims to have rotten luck due to the misfortunes that frequently happen to him.\n\nOne day, a girl calling herself Index Librorum Prohibitorum mysteriously lands on Touma's balcony and explains to him that she is being hunted down by magicians. This leads the powerless boy to discover a whole new world—one where magic exists. With Touma facing the problems that arise from both the scientific and magical sides of the world, how will he resolve them?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Beneath it is the noxious underbelly known as The Scrapyard, where the city stockpiles all of its waste. Living amongst the vast heaps of garbage are humans and cyborgs, surviving by any means necessary.\n\nDaisuke Ido, a doctor specializing in cyborg repairs, finds the head of a young female cyborg while scavenging a pile of old android parts. Proceeding to build her a new body, he names her Gally. Upon activation, Gally does not seem to remember anything about her past life. Nonetheless, she does not seem to mind as long as she stays by Ido’s side.\n\nHowever, she soon discovers that Ido has a side job as a hunter-warrior, a bounty hunter working for The Scrapyard’s government. Despite Ido’s warning, she decides to become one herself, awakening her forgotten knowledge of fighting techniques. Equipped with newfound strength, Gally is determined to fight through the alleys of The Scrapyard and beyond, retrieving fragments from her past to rediscover her true identity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

It was republished under the VIZ Graphic Novels imprint from July 6, 1995, to December 6, 1998, and again under the VIZ Action imprint from December 31, 2003, to March 1, 2005. Kodansha Comics took over the license and released the series digitally from May 26, 2017, to July 31, 2018.

Oscar winning director James Cameron was introduced to Gunnm by fellow director Guillermo del Toro, and subsequently purchased the rights to a live-action film adaptation in 2000.

The film premiered on February 14, 2019.",

Misaki Ayuzawa is the first female student council president of the school, eventually earning the nickname of the \"Demon President\" due to her mastery of Aikido and imposed iron rule.\n\nHowever, Misaki harbors an embarrassing secret—she has to work at a maid café to support her family. If anybody from her school was to find out, her reputation would be utterly destroyed. And after Takumi Usui—the most popular boy at school—discovers her secret, that might just happen. Kaichou wa Maid-sama! follows their story as they spend more time together and eventually begin to understand each other's secrets.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 1: Toumei na Sekai (Transparent World)",

She often uses it as an excuse to avoid doing things she dislikes, such as participating in her physical education class or getting along with her classmates. Out of concern and good will, her teacher assigns her to find the meaning of \"happiness.\"\n\nWhile Nanoka thinks about her homework, she often meets Abazure-san, a cheerful lady who helps her save a cat. Nanoka also pays regular visits to Obaa-chan, an old woman spending her twilight years in the woods. One day, Nanoka gets lost in the forest and stumbles across a high school girl named Minami committing self harm. As Nanoka gets closer to these three unique individuals, their stories and experiences shape for her a pathway toward soul-searching and self-discovery.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To keep a promise he made to them, Yuuichi saves up enough money to join them on the school trip. But when the gathered money mysteriously goes missing, suspicion falls on two of Yuuichi's friends: Shiho Sawaragi and Makoto Shibe, who were in charge of collecting the payments. Although innocent, Shiho and Makoto take responsibility for the failure to protect the money when no one else comes forward.\n\nA few days later, Yuuichi and his friends receive mysterious letters which trick each of them into meeting up. Upon arrival, they are ambushed and knocked unconscious. They wake up in a mysterious room in the presence of \"Manabu-kun,\" a character from a controversial children's show that stopped airing due to its malicious content. He informs the group that one of them indirectly gathered them together in order to settle a large debt. They are to play a \"friendship game\": a series of games that will test the strength of their bond and trust in each other. As the group's faith wavers due to the growing number of secrets and betrayals, Yuuichi must figure out who of his \"friends\" he can actually trust and ultimately discover the identity of the traitor.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After hanging out at a bar, Arisu and his best friends, Daikichi Karube and Chouta Segawa, wait for the first train to arrive in the morning. Suddenly, a colorful array of fireworks set off in the sky, and an enormous blinding firework renders them unconscious.\n\nThe trio finds themselves back at the bar covered in dust, discovering that the city has become a barren wasteland. But instead of being worried, Arisu feels alive for the very first time in his life and relishes the freedom of this lifeless city. However, his bliss is cut short when the group rashly enters a festival venue. Seeing its delicacies and lively ambiance, they think the place is a dream; unbeknownst to them, it will be the setting for their first deadly game.\n\nTogether with his friends, Arisu slowly enters the mysterious area known as the Borderland—an unknown country where every game puts their lives at stake, and a single misstep can lead to their demise.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, luck does not seem to be on her side, as she has yet to land a major role despite making her debut seven years ago. Still, Yura continues to put her best foot forward and receives a role in a movie destined for success. Much to her dismay, she is once again cast in a minor role.\n\nOnce on set, Yura runs into two familiar faces—her narcissistic ex-boyfriend Kim Jeong-u and famous actor Kang Seunghyeon. While Yura promises herself to keep her head in the game despite Jeong-u's egotistical presence, the handsome Seunghyeon takes an interest in her due to the circumstances of their previous encounters. Through the strenuous filming, the unknown actress and the lead star form a unique relationship. All the while, Yura tackles the relentless challenges of the entertainment industry on her journey to stardom.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "It is just another ordinary day for Satoru Mikami. The sun is shining brightly on the streets of Tokyo, and he is in the midst of a discussion with his colleagues when suddenly he gets stabbed by a passing robber. The average 37-year-old corporate worker is now at death's door, and he has only one regret—dying a virgin. Fading out, he is startled by a mysterious AI-like voice reciting commands. \n\nSatoru abruptly wakes up in the middle of a strange cave, but something odd has happened: he is now a goop of slime! Thanks to his new body, he has acquired the skill to absorb anything and obtain its appearance and abilities. While testing out his newfound powers and exploring the cave, he stumbles upon a massive dragon named Veldora, who has been sealed away for the past three hundred years. After quickly befriending the beast, Satoru decides to help him escape; in exchange, Satoru is bestowed a new name: \"Rimuru Tempest.\"\n\nWishing to avoid a life like his boring and mundane past, Rimuru is about to set out on a grand quest that will change his own destiny and the fate of his new world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Amongst the school's many clubs is the SKET Brigade, officially known as the Living Assistance Club. Comprised of the somewhat idiotic Yuusuke \"Bossun\" Fujisaki, the gallant Hime \"Himeko\" Onizuka, and the silent but surprisingly popular Kazuyoshi \"Switch\" Usui, the SKET Brigade is dedicated to solving various problems on campus. However, the club rarely receives requests, so the members spend most of their time messing around with random, trivial matters. Both hilarious and heartwarming, SKET Dance is a lighthearted comedy following the daily high school lives of an odd trio of friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "\"Parasites\" are tennis ball sized creatures, whose numbers and origins are unknown. They invade and take over the human mind in order to survive. Shinichi Izumi is a 16-year-old high school student who lives with his parents in a quiet neighborhood. One night, a Parasite invades Shinichi's body in an attempt to take control of it. However, it fails to complete the takeover process and ultimately ends up inhabiting only his right arm. \n\nThus, both Shinichi and the Parasite—who calls himself Migi—retain their individual minds. Now in a peculiar \"human and alien\" relationship, Migi proposes that they cooperate to survive. Shinichi has no choice but to agree, and he must now cling to his morality as he and Migi face off against other bloodthirsty Parasites.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day not long after entering the fourth grade, Sakura finds a mysterious book titled The Clow hidden within her father's bookshelves. Upon opening it, a small, winged creature with an Osakan accent comes out of the book and introduces itself as Keroberos, the Creature of the Seal who guards magical cards known as the Clow Cards and keeps them from escaping the book.\n\nUnfortunately for the plushy guardian, it seems that the Clow Cards have already escaped—and now Sakura is tasked with capturing them before the cards unleash their powers and cause havoc all over Tomoeda! With the support of the tiny guardian who she nicknames \"Kero\" and her best friend, Tomoyo Daidouji, Sakura must wield a magical bird-shaped key and use her new powers as the Cardcaptor to maintain peace and ensure that everything is alright.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Sakaki, who towers over Chiyo, is aloof and intimidating; Tomo Takino is loud and annoying; Ayumu \"Osaka\" Kasuga is absentminded but great at solving riddles; Koyomi \"Yomi\" Mizuhara is obsessed with diets and loves karaoke despite her awful singing; and Kagura, who is a competitive tomboy.\n\nAs the classmates become good friends over time, they experience their everyday lives together—things like school, studying, going on summer trips, and engaging in all kinds of shenanigans!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Chinatsu and his older brother, Fuyuki, have been trained by their father to become professional assassins for their whole lives. However, Fuyuki is slain as a result of Chinatsu failing at his first job. Chinatsu is discovered by a blind boy who lends him a shoulder to cry on.\n\nThe trauma still haunts Chinatsu five years later, and he is unable to kill any of his targets as a result. While waiting around the streets, he recovers a stolen object owned by Kasumi, the blind boy he had met back then. As a token of gratitude, Kasumi invites the assassin to his home that is located in a traditional Japanese inn. Chinatsu learns that the boy sees himself as a burden to his family due to his disability.\n\nDespite being complete strangers, Kasumi feels a connection with Chinatsu and asks him to be his friend, to which the assassin readily agrees. But Chinatsu discovers more from being around Kasumi's kindhearted nature, and he realizes he may have found a way through the darkness of his life: a light worth protecting amidst the abyss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But in addition to obscurity, he has another problem: his Shinki, or weapon partner, has decided to resign, tired of being with a homeless god. Left with no weapon, Yato takes on more jobs, hoping to find a new partner soon.\n\nWhile out putting up fliers for a missing cat, Yato sees said cat and chases after him, right into the path of an oncoming vehicle. Hiyori Iki, a nearby girl, rushes to push Yato out of the way and ends up hurting herself. After waking up in the hospital, she discovers the incident has knocked her soul loose from her body. Realizing his actions caused this, Yato promises to help return Hiyori to normal—for five yen of course. But in order to return her to normal, he requires a new Shinki, which he finds in the rebellious spirit Yukine.\n\nNoragami tells the story of a girl walking the line between two worlds and a stray deity's quest for a place to call his own.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In the aftermath of the tragedy, she finds herself reborn as a lowly spider hatchling, one amongst thousands in a vast cave. Furthermore, the world she is reincarnated into is a point-based skill system, prompting her to level up as quickly as possible if she is to survive the treacherous environment and persevere in the face of insurmountable odds.\n\nThus begins a little spider's journey of clawing, biting, and plotting her way to the top. Forced to confront the powerful beings that reign over the Great Elroe Labyrinth and beyond, she will gradually uncover the truth behind the mysterious fantasy world and the explosion that sent her there.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After Rachel disappears in a veil of light, Bam follows her, vowing to ascend the Tower in hopes of meeting her again.\n\nBut the Tower is a dangerous place full of ancient secrets, fearsome monsters, and nefarious humans. Each floor is protected by an Administrator who puts the daring challengers through grueling tests that will push them to their limits.\n\nAs he confronts Headon, the Administrator of the first floor, Bam learns that he is an ''Irregular,'' someone who was not chosen by the Tower but was able to enter it on his own, an extremely rare event inside the Tower. Regardless of this revelation, however, his path forward is clear. Be it wealth, power, glory, or even reuniting with Rachel, all desires will be realized at the top of the Tower.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Emilico is just one of many \"Living Dolls\" serving in the Shadows House, residents of which are pitch black from head to toe and constantly leak soot that stains the house black. Each \"Shadow\" is partnered with a Doll, which strangely resembles the other. As a Living Doll, Emilico must keep the house sparkling clean as well as act as the face for her master, Kate. In turn, Kate supports Emilico and treats her as her confidant.\n\nAs far as either of them can remember, this has always been the way their world works. However, the bond between a Shadow and a Doll isn't quite clear. Administrators watch over the young pairs from the higher levels of the mansion and judge them—but for what purpose?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But there is more to this struggling adult than meets the eye, as he possesses a mysterious ability which takes him back in time right before a life-threatening incident occurs. When \"Revival,\" as he calls it, triggers, it will continue to send him back again and again until he is able to save the lives of the individuals involved.\n\nBut Satoru's life is about to take a turn for the worse when a loved one is killed by an unknown man and he is framed for the crime. Desperate to get away so that he can assess his situation, he is inexplicably sent 18 years into the past—right before the disappearance and death of his classmate, Kayo Hinazuki, an event that has plagued him since childhood.\n\nSatoru, now an elementary school student, must get his wits together and save the young girl from an untimely demise by figuring out the identity of the person responsible. But just how is Kayo's murder connected to the present?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Hoping to unite their countries with an alliance, The Empress of Austria arranges for her daughter, the delightful yet spoiled Marie Antoinette, to marry the crown prince of France, Louis XVI. Upon arriving in Versailles, the Austrian princess meets Oscar François de Jarjayes, Captain of the Royal Guards—a seemingly dashing young man—but to Antoinette's astonishment, he is in fact a woman!\n\nThe youngest daughter of a noble family with a prominent lack of a male heir, Oscar was raised as a boy to continue the family's military legacy. Suffocated by the rigid rules associated with her new position and longing for companionship, Antoinette immediately takes a liking to this intriguing young woman and wastes no time befriending her. However, as the childish new queen foolishly abuses her power, Oscar is conflicted between maintaining her loyalty to the royal family and addressing the growing concern of poverty among the common people.\n\nDespite being unjustly burdened by family expectations and forced to deny their identities at the expense of personal happiness, Antoinette and Oscar march on to become key players in the annals of history.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Versailles no Bara is set during the 1789 French Revolution. It became an instant success with millions of copies sold around the world since its appearance on May 21, 1972. With the rise in Japanese interest in French culture as a result of the series' release, the French government acknowledged the manga's impact in promoting French history and granted Riyoko Ikeda the Legion of Honor on March 11, 2009. In 1983, the first two volumes of the manga were translated into English by Frederik L. Schodt for the purpose of teaching English to Japanese speakers. This version was released in North America by the North American branch of Sanyusha and is the first commercially translated manga to be available in the country. It was published in English as The Rose of Versailles by Udon Entertainment as four omnibus volumes from February 4, 2020, to April 6, 2021. The series was released in French in two volumes by Kana from October 5, 2002, to December 7, 2002; both volumes were reissued on January 7, 2011. The manga was also released in Italian in five volumes by Edizioni BD on December 9, 2020. The series has been adapted into several Takarazuka Revue musicals. These shows led to a large resurgence in the popularity of Japanese revues; it came to be known as the \"Berubara Boom.\" The manga has also received a live-action movie adaptation titled Lady Oscar, which was released in Japan on March 3, 1979.",

One day, the fantasy she has always dreamed of comes true—awakening in a boy's body and experiencing the thrills of the city. Meanwhile, high school student Taki Tachibana finds himself waking up as a girl living in a lakeside town by the mountains, the complete opposite of the Tokyo life that he is familiar with.\n\nAs Mitsuha and Taki discover they are living the lives of one another in their dreams, the two begin working together to adjust to this new reality. Little do they know, their fragile relationship soon prompts the pair to search for each other in fierce defiance of the thin thread of fate that connects them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The good-natured Souta Aoki has had his heart stolen by the angelic smile and kind actions of his female crush, Mio Hashimoto. Unfortunately, he is devastated when she lends him an eraser with another classmate's name—Ida—engraved on top. When Kousuke Ida spots his name on the eraser, he is led to believe that Aoki is the one harboring romantic feelings for him. Aoki is left struggling to clear up the situation alone without revealing Hashimoto's feelings for Ida. Fake and honest pinings mix as misunderstandings abound in this heart-pounding triangle of first loves.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "1945, Japan. Gen Nakaoka is a spirited six-year-old boy who lives with his poor yet loving family in wartime Hiroshima. As the second World War rages on, Gen's father Daikichi stands among the few outspoken who are opposed to the emperor and stand for the innocent civilians bearing the brunt of the war. However, in a society with nothing but feverous support for their nation, Gen and his family are ostracized as traitors. Unbeknownst to them, a terrible fate awaits the people of Hiroshima...\n\nOne quiet morning, the US forces drop an atomic bomb on Hiroshima. In an instant, the city is completely destroyed, leaving thousands dead and many more exposed to radiation. Though Gen manages to survive the blast, he finds his life irreversibly changed. Regrouping with what's left of his family, Gen must now grapple with starvation, destitution, and an unsympathetic public who see survivors as little more than disease-ridden beggars.\n\nBased on author Keiji Nakazawa's real-life experiences, Hadashi no Gen follows Gen and his fellow survivors in their struggle to survive in post-war Hiroshima. Gen resolves to soldier on with unwavering determination, while never forgiving those who caused the atrocity, never forgetting the pain of the bomb, and never letting his spirit be broken by the tragedy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Hadashi no Gen is based on the events experienced by author Keiji Nakazawa and other survivors of Hiroshima. After publishing the one-shot Ore wa Mita, Nakazawa's editor encouraged him to write more of his experiences. The manga was first serialized in Shonen Jump in 1973, but was cancelled the following year due to low polling. It continued publication in three different magazines until concluding in 1987—Shimin (Citizen), Bunka Hyouron (Cultural Criticism), and Kyouiku Hyouron (Educational Criticism). Nakazawa planned to write a sequel following Gen becoming a mangaka in Tokyo, but this idea was scrapped when he retired due to failing eyesight and illness. Hadashi no Gen was first published in English as Gen of Hiroshima in comic book format by EduComics, in cooperation with the pacifist organization Project Gen, a group of voluntary translators that sought to bring the manga to a larger audience. Volunteers around the world likewise picked up this project, partially translating this title into French, Italian, German, Portuguese, Swedish, Finnish, Norwegian, Indonesian, Tagalog, Esperanto, and by 1994, completely into Russian. In English, only two comic book issues were released originally between January 1980 and April 1981 before the publication was cancelled. Since then, a number of publishers partially published the series as Barefoot Gen, including New Society Publishers, who published the first four volumes from September 3, 1986 to December 1, 1993; Penguin Books, who published the first two volumes from August 1, 1989 to August 1, 1990, under the Penguin Originals imprint, with a new edition published July 27, 1995; and Last Gasp, who started publication from September, 1986, initially only publishing the first four volumes. After the revival of Project Gen, Last Gasp finally published all ten volumes unabridged (with ) from September 1, 2004 to February 1, 2010.",

        "synopsis": "Narumi Momose is a petite and cute young woman who loves idols, games, and everything anime or manga-related, especially in the boys' love genre. In other words, she is a closet otaku and more specifically, a fujoshi. After a breakup due to these kind of interests, she quits her job and joins a new company. At her new workplace, the only colleagues who know about her secret are her childhood friend Hirotaka Nifuji, a blunt gaming otaku; Hanako Koyanagi, a cool and mature-looking beauty; and Tarou Kabakura, an attractive guy with a scary face who always gets into fights with Hanako.\n\nWhile having drinks to catch up, Hirotaka advises Narumi to date someone who would understand her hobbies. But she is hesitant—otakus are typically perceived as gross, and the only ones who can understand them are otakus themselves. Or could a relationship between two otakus work?\n\nFollowing the relationship of Narumi and Hirotaka as they begin dating, Wotaku ni Koi wa Muzukashii is a light-hearted story about those who try to balance work, relationships, and hobbies.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Nakoshi agrees to let Manabu Ito, a 22-year-old medical student, drill a hole in his skull in exchange for 700,000 yen. The procedure bears no results at first, with Nakoshi showing no abnormalities. This normalcy comes to an abrupt end, however, when Nakoshi begins seeing the homunculus in every person. With his perception distorted, how will Nakoshi face these homunculi?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

There was a man. Atsuomi Ayanokouji, aged 31. A politician. Atsuomi was born as a \"have-not\" in Japan's society of disparity, but there was one thing he possessed more than anybody else: his uncontrollable, ever-expanding \"ambition.\"\n\nAtsuomi had been doing dirty work for Jinnosuke Naoe, the head of the Naoe faction that he was a part of. As a chance to reward all the hard work that he had done, Naoe offers him a top-secret project: the founding of an institution for a \"Talented Persons Nurturing Program,\" which is under the direct control of the government. Atsuomi, who is busy pursuing his ambitions, brings them to fruition and names the institution he establishes the White Room. He had also started on another project: to get his own biological child to join him in the White Room.\n\nThis is the beginning of everything. A story about the \"dissection\" of Kiyotaka Ayanokouji. Within a cold white room, what does the future look like in the eyes of a young child?\n\n(Source: Kadokawa, translated)",

Meanwhile, the future bride of the local minister lives in luxury, her every need taken care of so long as she remains an obedient wife.\n\nWhen an unfortunate accident leads to their fateful encounter, the pair who have nothing in common find themselves sharing the same wish—to leave their undesirable lives behind and die at the hands of fate.\n\nLoosely based on a Korean folktale of the same name, Her Tale of Shim Chong follows two girls from different walks of life as they learn to accept themselves for who they are in a world where women are seen as less than equal.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, things do not go as planned when, instead of the literature department, he is assigned to Emerald—the shoujo manga department! To make things worse, his new boss, Masamune Takano, is an unsubtle slave driver willing to go as far as kissing Onodera to act as a reference for a manga artist. Nevertheless, Onodera is driven to prove himself, hoping that his good performance will allow him to transfer someday.\n\nOnodera slowly settles into the flow of the surprisingly all-male Emerald Department, and the romantically-themed work reminds him of his high school ex-boyfriend and first love. Not wanting to think about that jerk, he focuses on learning the ropes from Takano, who behaves strangely the more he learns about Onodera's past. It all comes to a head when they finally recognize each other: Takano is the jerk who broke Onodera's heart, but according to Takano, it was Onodera who suddenly left him without a word.\n\nEmerald's passionate editors already know plenty about romance, but they can learn even more about it themselves once they meet their one and only true love. In Onodera's case, it is only a matter of time until he realizes that he is still very much in the middle of the \"world's greatest first love.\"\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Incapable of saying no to anyone, he has always performed whatever life-threatening jobs his greedy and lazy parents requested. His life takes an unexpected turn when they form a contract with Sullivan, a high-ranking demon, at the cost of his soul. Afraid and confused, Iruma is surprised that all Sullivan wants is to act as his grandfather.\n\nSullivan takes care of Iruma and decides to enroll him in the demon school Babyls. Iruma's greatest challenge is hiding his status as a human, so keeping a low profile among his peers is the only option. However, Iruma will soon discover that he is no ordinary human, and the demons might also be more than what meets the eye.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One day, on her way home, Noriko stumbles upon a bomb disguised as a paper bag that explodes right in front of her. However, instead of dying, she is transported to a mysterious forest full of strange plants and creatures.\n\nAs she begins navigating through the woods, Noriko is suddenly attacked by a giant, worm-like monster. Fortunately, she is saved by Izark Kia Tarj, a swordsman who does not speak her language. Lacking the strength to survive on her own, Noriko decides to follow her stoic savior, taking the opportunity to learn the foreign land's language and be more useful to Izark.\n\nUnbeknownst to her, Noriko is a crucial piece of an ancient prophecy. She is \"The Awakening\"—a being destined to unleash the greatest evil known as the \"Sky Demon.\" With influential people plotting to capture Noriko for her supposed powers, both she and Izark must fend for themselves and overcome a future laced with chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the middle of a forest rests an abandoned piano. If one were to walk by, they may hear music coming from it, and sitting at the chair is a young boy: Kai Ichinose. He lives with his young, single mother—who works as a prostitute—and he is somewhat of a troublemaker at school when it comes to defending transfer student Shuuhei Amamiya from class bullies.\n\nShuuhei comes from a family of distinguished pianists, so he is expected to follow in their footsteps. He practices rigorously every day to live up to his parents' expectations. Meanwhile, Kai—with help from his teacher, a former pianist legend—wants to not only reach Shuuhei's level of success, but also wants to become the best pianist from Japan. This rivalry between the two friends will not only raise their talents to new levels, but it will also inspire other rising pianists from all over the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since her parents abandoned her at a young age, it has been the center of her hardship, driving her to the point of selling herself to the slave market, just to secure a place she can call home.\n\nPresented to the bidders as a rare \"Sleigh Beggy\"—beings who have an unusually high affinity to magical energies—Chise's last remaining hope appears in the form of Elias Ainsworth, a mysterious magus more beast than man. Rather than keep her as a slave, he has decided to make her his apprentice, as well as his bride.\n\nChise is not only physically transported to the English countryside where Elias lives, but also introduced to a world where wondrous things such as fairies and dragons are the norm. But she soon realizes there is as much to fear in her new life as there is to marvel at. And lying at the heart of it all is the question of whether she has fallen into the hands of something much darker than her own inner demons.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "On the Hawaiian Islands, siblings Dragona and Jodio Joestar commit petty crimes to provide aid for their ailing mother Barbara Ann. Under the orders of Meryl May Qi, both a crime lord and their high school principal, the siblings work alongside fellow teenagers Usagi Alohaoe and Paco Laburantes. Together, the gang engages in outright robbery, fraudulent activity, and other schemes to rip off unsuspecting tourists and civilians.\n\nFifteen-year-old Jodio admires his older brother's strong sense of identity and his mother's incredible work ethic, but there is a darkness within him, one characterized by violent outbursts that he carries out with a cold stoicism. Diagnosed as a sociopath, Jodio is quick to brutalize those who threaten his loved ones. His one objective is to make money by any means necessary, both to support his family and to become filthy rich in his own right.\n\nOn one particular heist, the gang robs manga artist Rohan Kishibe of a seemingly ordinary lava rock. However, they soon find that the rock draws any object of high value that it touches to its wielder, no matter the distance or bizarre chain of circumstances it takes to get there. With this new power in hand, Jodio and his allies set out to become wealthier than they ever dreamed possible.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "The Lombardis were the most powerful family that ever existed in the empire. With unimaginable wealth, they shaped history, culture, and the arts—their influence rivaling that of the emperor. However, the family collapsed after making an alliance with the first prince, which resulted in futility as the second-born Perez Brivachali Durelli was crowned instead.\n\nA Korean woman is reincarnated as Firentia, the daughter of a Lombardi and a commoner. Despite her status as an illegitimate child, her father and grandfather love her, and she works hard to keep her family's prestige intact. After the two pass away, Firentia is kicked out and has since regretted how her relatives have torn the Lombardi name to shreds.\n\nOn the verge of dying due to a carriage accident, Firentia is mysteriously given another chance in life and wakes up as her seven-year-old self. Firentia will not waste this opportunity, and if she wants to save her father and prevent the Lombardi's fall, she must prove to her grandfather her merit to become the next head of the family.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Under these new circumstances, Being X believes that, should this man succumb to relentless suffering, he will call upon the heavens for assistance.\n\nStarting life again as a young girl named Tanya Degurechaff, the salaryman quickly utilizes his past experiences and volunteers to the military of his country, the Empire. Wielding tremendous potential despite being a child, Tanya's prodigious capacity for strategic and magical warfare allows her to quickly ascend the ranks and consistently lead her nation to miraculous victories in the ongoing war. Even so, she does all of this for one purpose: to live in the backlines far from the warzone, effectively defying Being X's objectives.\n\nHowever, as Tanya strives to escape Being X's influence, she soon comes to know that even with her genius, there are situations that a human simply cannot overcome without divine intervention.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With some encouragement from a childhood friend, Mikado moves to Ikebukuro, a lively downtown district in Tokyo. However, the naïve boy may be in for a lot more than he bargained for.\n\nIkebukuro is home to a host of strange individuals, such as a monster of a man dressed in a bartender's outfit, a sadist who sells information for fun, and an underground doctor with an odd infatuation. But the most unusual of them all is the legendary \"Black Rider,\" a headless being who silently rides through the night on a pitch-black motorcycle. When Mikado witnesses this urban legend on his first night in the city, his initial excitement triggers a thrilling but deadly sequence of events, affecting numerous others throughout the city.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "\"If the life that you had regained, was one that I had breathed back into you... Is it too much to hope for you to love me back with that life?\" \n\nThe year is 1926, in Japan-occupied Joseon. 17-year-old Soo-a is an illiterate handmaiden working for the household of a prominent Japanese collaborator. One day, she discovered an injured young man lying unconscious at the beach, an independence activist called Eui-hyeon. The sweet and innocent Soo-a nursed him back to health, and Eui-hyeon told her the tale of the \"Little Mermaid,\" a princess of the sea who saved a prince from his death. Having fallen in love with Eui-hyeon, Soo-a was determined to meet him once again. But she knew not then, of the fate that awaited the \"Little Mermaid\" on her quest to reunite with her beloved.\n\n(Source: MU)",

As Saki collects herself, the stranger picks up the sheet music Saki dropped, hands it to Saki together with a band-aid, and continues on her way—all without saying a word. Saki is left wondering about the identity of the tall, lovely stranger, only to discover the next day that she is one of her classmates at her new high school. The girl's name is Kanon, and though she is hearing impaired, she refuses any kind of support or \"special treatment\" from her teachers or classmates. Over the course of the year, Saki slowly grows closer to Kanon and begins to chip away at her cold exterior.\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",

Mikan naively believes that her aloof best friend would always be by her side until Hotaru decides to depart for Tokyo to attend Alice Academy. The school is home to gifted children who possess unique abilities known as Alices. Heartbroken and feeling abandoned, Mikan runs away from home in pursuit of her friend, hoping that she too can enroll in the prestigious institution.\n\nAs Mikan gets accepted as a student at Alice Academy and reunites with her friend, she quickly learns that the academy is not all fun and games. The school itself is divided into a hierarchy system based on the strength of their Alice, behavior, and academic performance, as well as classifying each student under a specific Alice subgroup for a more personalized education. When she finds herself in the lowest rank, Mikan faces bullying from her classmates who all believe that she does not belong. Natsume Hyuuga, one of the academy's highest-ranking students, is especially vitriolic towards Mikan for seemingly no reason.\n\nThe students begin to discover that the special academy has hidden secrets—many of which are a lot darker than one might think. As they unravel these mysteries, Mikan and her friends find themselves entangled in something far bigger than they could imagine.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Long ago, there was a god of light and a god of darkness. While those devoted to the god of light experienced happiness and good fortune, the god of darkness would play tricks on the people and steal their joy. And so, as the legend goes, the god of light decided to punish him by turning him into a monster. Enraged by this, the god of darkness wielded his punishment as a curse in order to inflict suffering upon others. Because of his actions, he was banished to the Outside, where he and his monstrous children are to remain for eternity, while those from the Inside must never come in contact with someone from the Outside, lest they be cursed with a hideous form.\n\nA little girl named Shiva, an Insider, is found by an Outsider she comes to know as Sensei. Though they cannot touch, Sensei cares for Shiva as best he can, and together they live a moderately happy life. But soon, Shiva not only finds herself in danger from the Outside, but from her own kind as well.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Determined to find new love after their recent misfortunes, the pair decide to cheer each other on while maintaining their usual dynamic of constant bickering. \n\nAlthough they continually deny it, Risa and Ootani are more similar than they like to admit: they both have unusual heights, failing grades, identical tastes in food, and a tendency to act extremely childish.

He leads a reclusive life as a hikikomori, ultimately coming to the bizarre conclusion that this happened due to some sort of conspiracy. One day just when his life seems entirely unchanging, he meets Misaki Nakahara, a mysterious girl who claims to be able to cure Tatsuhiro of his hikikomori ways. She presents him with a contract basically outlining that once a day they would meet in the evening in a local park where Misaki would lecture to Tatsuhiro in an effort to rid him of his lifestyle. During these outings, many subjects are discussed, though they almost always pertain in some way to psychology or psychoanalysis.",

        "synopsis": "One day, college student Yuuhi Amamiya is approached by talking lizard Sir Noi Crezant. Crezant immediately launches into a fantastical story: the powerful mage Animus intends to destroy the Earth with his Biscuit Hammer, a huge contraption looming high in Earth's orbit. Earth's only hope lies with the princess and her Beast Knights, whose task is to protect the princess and defeat Animus.\n\nYuuhi is chosen as the Lizard Beast Knight, and despite his misgivings, is quickly forced to defend himself from a golem created by the mage. He is saved by his neighbor, the princess Samidare Asahina, and swears loyalty to her. However, the princess does not intend to save the Earth at all. She lets Yuuhi in on her real motivations: to prevent Animus from destroying the Earth, only to then annihilate the planet by her own hand. The pair continue to fight off attacks by Animus' golems while the remaining Beast Knights are slowly being gathered and learning to use their powers. As he grows closer to Asahina, Yuuhi will have to decide for himself whether to go along with her plans or to save the Earth. In the process, he must also confront his true self and determine where his loyalties truly lie.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Telekinesis, teleportation, and astral projection might sound exciting to the average person, but from Saiki's viewpoint, they are nothing but an annoyance. Psychic powers are unnecessary—this is all that Saiki has believed since he was a kid.\n\nAs a secret esper with the sole dream of living an ordinary life, Saiki tries to use his psychic abilities to stay out of the public's gaze. However, having to clean up after his odd classmates and their antics, all the while keeping his psychic powers a secret, makes it rather difficult to achieve the peaceful life he desires.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Chounouryokusha Saiki Kusuo no Ψ-nan (pilot)\nVolume 2: Omaenchi, Obake Yashiki\nVolume 3: Gekidan!

At a park, she is approached by her schoolmate Rei Kashino—notorious for being a womanizer—who asks for directions. Distrustful of Rei's intentions, Kira quickly chalks a map for him and runs away. Little does she know that Rei finds one of her sketches on the back of the map and becomes captivated by her artistic skills.\n\nMuch to Kira's chagrin, Rei immediately recognizes her at school, but she ignores his attempts at striking up a conversation. However, Rei's sincere praise about her drawing leads Kira to see the violent rebel in a better light. After watching him kiss a statue of the god Mars, Kira feels so moved that she instantly requests him to model for her.\n\nAs Kira and Rei's chance encounter begins to develop into a flourishing relationship, what is to become of these two polar personalities?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Akira Itou is also walking the same line. He travels across a perilous wire, suspended dozens of feet above a cavern of icy blades. The day the two meet, death seems imminent; for how can the two pass each other without falling to their doom?\n\nNishi and Itou are both regular players of the solo \"White Line Game,\" and every day they meet. Supporting each other, they are able to successfully grow in skill and continue on their individual quests. But the more their shared path brings them together, the more frustrated Itou grows. They only ever meet during this game of theirs, and though it brings him happiness, Itou longs for more of the child-like Nishi. After being kissed by Nishi, Itou becomes so embarrassed that he feeds Nishi to the sharks. With regret in his heart, he is convinced that his one-sided crush now hates him.\n\nNishi, however, has only one regret about the encounter—and that is the sudden disappearance of Itou. When the two make amends, their perilous surroundings change and set them up to walk the white line together for the rest of their lives.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She dreams of creating a school band in the hopes that using her instrument will elevate her social standing. However, despite spending the last two years diligently practicing guitar, she is no closer to her goal.\n\nAlthough she has gained a following online for her guitar covers of popular songs, Bocchi's lack of social skills means that her dream may ultimately be impossible. But one day, drummer Nijika Ijichi spots Bocchi with her guitar alone in a park. Desperately in need of a guitarist, Nijika quickly recruits Bocchi to the band that Nijika has formed with bassist Ryou Yamada—Kessoku Band. Though overwhelmed and left floundering at the sudden social interaction, Bocchi realizes this may be the start of something bigger.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

With Kankichi's help, Souichirou begins to establish a life in Edo's tenements and exchanges his longtime sword Kunifusa for a bamboo blade, due to his newfound desire to refrain from violence.\n\nUnfortunately for Souichirou, avoiding conflict in Edo is not always possible. Before long, Souichirou finds himself stalked by the brutal assassin Shinnosuke Kikuchi, who delights in butchering anyone caught between him and his target. Each time Souichirou must step forward to defend himself or the people of the tenements, he reawakens the intense bloodlust of his younger days and resurrects memories he would much rather forget.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Sawako Kuronuma is a 15-year-old student often mistaken for the horrific, vengeful spirit Sadako Yamamura from The Ring. The uncanny resemblance leads to Sawako being called \"Sadako\" instead. Due to her aloof and gloomy appearance, her peers have grown afraid, and they keep their distance from her. But despite such treatment, she harbors an innocent and diligent heart.\n\nGiven her honest desire to make friends, Sawako holds a profound admiration for Shouta Kazehaya, the most popular boy in her class. Through his refreshing personality and smooth interpersonal interactions, Kazehaya naturally draws in people. Wishing to be more like him, Sawako begins to spend more time with Kazehaya. While attempting to turn over a new leaf, Sawako finds herself encouraged to explore new things that she never dared before, with Kazehaya right beside her.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 22: Mayuge no Kakudo wa 45° de (45° Eyebrows)",

        "synopsis": "Having begun a relationship, lovers Shun Hashimoto and Mio Chibana depart for Tokyo. Unlike the tranquil seaside town where they met, the city is a bustling metropolis, where people from all walks of life go about their lives. Even so, openly being in a homosexual relationship is never an easy task in a society that rejects those who go against the norm.\n\nTheir destination is Shun's family home, a place he left years ago after outing himself. Nearly everything is nostalgic about that place, from the very same dog to the very same roof, but a boisterous younger brother is an unexpected surprise. While Shun's mother wishes for the two to stay, his father remains emotionally disconnected from his son.\n\nAs they become reacquainted with family friends and grow accustomed to their new environment, Shun and Mio are faced with a seemingly insurmountable challenge—coming to terms with their pasts.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although the atmosphere in Tokyo has changed drastically due to the increased influence of the CCG, ghouls continue to pose a problem as they have begun taking caution, especially the terrorist organization Aogiri Tree, who acknowledge the CCG's growing threat to their existence.\n\nThe creation of a special team, known as the Quinx Squad, may provide the CCG with the push they need to exterminate Tokyo's unwanted residents. As humans who have undergone surgery in order to make use of the special abilities of ghouls, they participate in operations to eradicate the dangerous creatures. The leader of this group, Haise Sasaki, is a half-ghoul, half-human who has been trained by famed special class investigator, Kishou Arima. However, there's more to this young man than meets the eye, as unknown memories claw at his mind, slowly reminding him of the person he used to be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Following the 1986 Rokkenjima Mass Murder Incident, Ange Ushiromiya is the last surviving member of her family. Bearing immense guilt for being unable to accompany her parents and older brother Battler to the island, Ange has been desperate to know the truth behind the grim events. However, 12 years later, further hardships torment the grieving girl—isolating her from the world she once loved.\n\nOn the brink of giving up, Ange is visited by Frederica Bernkastel, the Witch of Miracles. As a spectator of Beatrice's games, Bernkastel offers Ange a chance to not only learn what occurred on Rokkenjima, but also exact revenge on the person who murdered her family. Despite the possibility that her wish will go unfulfilled, Ange accepts the deal and inherits the name of the Golden Witch, allowing her to travel back in time to assist Battler.\n\nThis new, spirited alliance provides Battler the conviction to fervently proceed in his uphill battle as the game board continues to transform in unexpected ways.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead, he is going straight to the unrivaled master of rakugo—a form of comedic Japanese storytelling—Yakumo Yuurakutei himself. Due to a series of events, Yotarou becomes enamored with rakugo, bent on becoming a shunichi. Yakumo, who never takes apprentices, almost immediately agrees to pass his trade on to Yotarou. Together with Konatsu, a young lady living in the household, they start struggling toward becoming the new hope for rakugo, which seems to be slowly withering away alongside the Shouwa era.\n\nHowever, as Yotarou gets to know his new mentor and \"big sis,\" he notices hints of a dark past in both of them. The environment of the household becomes strained and, at times, scary. Naturally, no hardships matter to the young Yotarou, as his gaze is set upon their mutual future—the future where he becomes the master of rakugo.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Takafumi Yokozawa has had his heart broken. In despair, he chooses to drown his sorrows the only way he knows how—with a metric ton of booze.\n\nAfter ending up blackout drunk, Takafumi wakes up naked in a hotel room. Greeted by Zen Kirishima, a coworker and editor-in-chief of the shounen manga magazine Japun, Takafumi finds himself being subjected to blackmail. As it turns out, Zen had taken some rather incriminating pictures the night before. Takafumi must follow along with the editor's every whim; he is tricked into drinking together, eating fancy meals he cannot afford, and even visiting the Kirishima household.\n\nSlowly, with the help of Zen and his daughter, Hiyori, Takafumi finds himself forgetting all about his broken heart.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The letter reveals a series of events that are supposed to take place that day. At first, Naho thinks it's just a prank; but when the letter mentions a transfer student named Kakeru Naruse, who really ends up transferring into her class later that day, she is forced to believe in its contents.\n\nAs Naho continues to read the letter, her future self mentions several regrets, urging Naho to take the right decisions now. Somehow these regrets all seem to be connected to Kakeru, and with the burden of the knowledge that the boy wouldn't be with her and her friends in the future, will Naho be able to make the perfect choices that will alter what seems to be fate?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nAlso includes Haru-iro Astronaut (Spring-Colored Astronaut) series.",
        "background": "After chapter 9 ran in Bessatsu Margaret magazine in November 2012, Orange went on hiatus for over a year. In 2013, the series switched publishers from Shueisha to Futabasha, which re-published the first two volumes, and starting from chapter 10, serialization moved to Monthly Action magazine starting in the February 2014 issue. After the series finished serialization in the October 2015 issue, side stories were published intermittently in the April 2016 through July 2017 issues, and on Web Action from July 16, 2021 to April 8, 2022. The series has sold a total of 1.6 million copies since it was serialized, with the fourth volume ranking 25 on Oricon's weekly manga rankings chart. Orange also ranked 15th among male readers in the 2015 Kono Manga ga Sugoi! magazine. A live-action film adaptation was released in Japan on December 12, 2015. The first five volumes of Orange were published in English by Seven Seas Entertainment in two omnibus volumes from January 26 to May 31, 2016, the sixth volume on January 23, 2018, and the seventh on March 7, 2023. Crunchyroll published the manga digitally starting on January 24, 2014. It is also published in Spanish by Tomodomo Ediciones, in Polish by Waneko, and in Brazilian Portuguese by Editora Jbc.",

He has reached adulthood alone in his cage, avoided by potential owners for petty reasons like not being cute enough or being snotty. His fortune changes one day when an elderly gentleman named Fuyuki Kanda comes into the store and chooses to take him home. As a widower left behind by his grown-up children, Kanda seeks a feline companion to alleviate his solitude.\n\nAt times humorous and others heartwarming, Ojisama to Neko follows Kanda and the newly named Fukumaru as they experience the joys of living together and learning about each other.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Through these exploits, the true nature of the world is slowly pieced together.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She works part-time at a nursery school where the cute two-year-old twins Akane and Aoi Matsunaga attend. One day, a handsome young man named Seiji Matsunaga comes rushing to pick up the twins, but they refuse to go home with him, clinging onto Shiharu instead. Shocked by the children's strong attachment to Shiharu, Seiji urgently requests for her to babysit them, offering to pay twice the amount she currently earns at the daycare. Shiharu realizes the cash will cover her living and schooling expenses while also providing the experience she needs to fulfill her dream.\n\nLove So Life follows the happy days of Shiharu as she finds herself falling in love with her makeshift family, and the twins as they live out their early childhood playing, learning, and growing.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "After two eccentrically dressed individuals ambush her, high school student Yukari Hayasaka promptly passes out due to shock. She soon awakens to find herself surrounded by even more strangely dressed people in the basement studio of Paradise Kiss—a fashion design club composed of four students from Yazawa School for the Arts. Although it seems like Yukari has been kidnapped, the older students explain that they only approached her to see if she would model their collection for an upcoming fashion show.\n\nBeing a senior with a busy schedule, Yukari furiously rejects the group's offer. But when she drops her student passbook in her haste to leave, the ringleader of the group, George Koizumi, picks it up and uses it as a means to coerce Yukari into considering their request. After hearing about the other members' unbridled ambition, Yukari is inspired to reevaluate her own circumstances and eventually agrees to help them out.\n\nNow as Paradise Kiss' model, Yukari must learn to balance her new responsibilities with her hectic personal life. However, the more time she spends with George and the rest of the team, the harder it becomes for her to avoid getting swept up in the glitz and glamor of the fashion world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Emi is kind and generous by nature and therefore determined to give Remilia the life she deserves. Her warmth soon charms every key character, and she ensures Remilia's bright future. For a decade, Remilia has watched over Emi from the inside, satisfied as long as the tender-hearted Emi was happy herself.\n\nThe arrival of the protagonist, Pina Blanche, envelops Emi's world in darkness. From the beginning, Pina shows her true colors, resorting to underhanded methods to destroy Remilia's reputation until everyone turns against her. When despair overwhelms Emi, control over her body returns to Remilia. But Remilia is not so forgiving that she will simply let Pina have her way. She swears to take revenge and show everyone who wronged Emi the power of a true villainess.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Kim Gong-Ja, a weak F-Class hunter without any skills, is envious of those who were blessed by the Tower. Letting his jealousy overcome him one day, Gong-Ja abruptly receives a S-Class skill that allows him to copy a skill from someone else—after they kill him.\n\nSooner than he likes, Gong-Ja gets to test his newly acquired ability on the legendary hunter known as the Flame Emperor. As he is dying, Gong-Ja learns the evil truth about the man he once admired the most. Receiving another potent skill that allows him to revive and go back in time by 24 hours, Gong-Ja devises a plan to travel 11 years into the past to eliminate the Flame Emperor and cement himself as the world's best hunter.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "There is a rumor that a magician lives in the tent by the abandoned theme park; some even say his magic is real. However, before he starts his show, he always asks his audience: \"Do you believe in magic?\"\n\nFor Yoon Ah-ee, magic seems like a distant memory. Faced with the harsh reality of poverty, she spends all her time studying, working, and taking care of her younger sister in the absence of their parents. She no longer believes in the wonders of magic, just like her skeptical classmate Na Il-Deung, who has been brought up to believe that a good education is the only way to approach life.\n\nWhen Ah-ee stumbles into the abandoned theme park and has a chance encounter with the magician, her life is changed forever. Annarasumanara reveals a philosophical, heartwarming, and thought-provoking story of what it means to grow up into the person you want to be.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Although he is pleased by its peacefulness, the tranquility of the surface quickly bores him. However, his peaceful lifestyle is soon interrupted after he returns one evening to see a crying child outside of his front gate. He decides to take in the abandoned girl and names her \"Hana\" on a whim—keeping her for mere entertainment and as a way to kill time. Unconcerned about the future, he pledges to abandon her if she becomes troublesome. \n\nFourteen years later, Hana continues to mature and grow on Vivi. Perplexed by her unwavering loyalty, he remains unsure of his feelings toward her. Can he really continue to maintain his old, unconcerned facade?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "It, a mysterious immortal being, is sent to the Earth with no emotions nor identity. However, It is able to take the shape of those around that have a strong impetus.\n\nAt first, It is a sphere. Then, It imitates the form of a rock. As the temperature drops and snow falls atop the moss, It inherits the moss. When an injured, lone wolf comes limping by and lays down to die, It takes on the form of the animal. Finally, It gains consciousness and begins to traverse the empty tundra until It meets a boy.\n\nThe boy lives alone in a ghost town, which the adults abandoned long ago in search of the paradise said to exist far beyond the endless sea of white tundra. However, their efforts were for naught, and now the boy is in a critical state.\n\nAcquiring the form of the boy, It sets off on a never-ending journey, in search of new experiences, places, and people.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Mion will become the next heir of the Sonozaki family, and Shion will attend St. Lucia Academy, away from her dear sister and their relatives. But Shion escapes the school and returns to Hinamizawa, unaware of the cruel tragedy awaiting her.\n\nWhen she reunites with her sister and gets a part-time job—while pretending to be Mion—she meets Satoshi Houjou, a boy her age with whom she falls madly in love. But when she learns about Satoshi's horrible family situation, she begins to resent everyone in his household—even his younger sister, Satoko. When tensions escalate and Satoshi abruptly goes missing, Shion begins to suspect that her own family may have had something to do with his disappearance.\n\nA year later, Shion meets Keiichi Maebara, Mion's crush. Her sister's infatuation with Keiichi stirs up her old feelings for Satoshi, and awakens a vicious desire to find out the truth behind his disappearance once and for all. However, Shion's quest for the truth will send her spiraling down a dark path of madness and despair.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

As a result, he is forced to ingest a poison that is supposed to kill him, but unexpectedly shrinks his body to the size of a grade-schooler instead. Now believed to be dead, Shinichi takes up the alias of Conan Edogawa (a compound of the names of the famous mystery authors Arthur Conan Doyle and Ranpo Edogawa) in order to hide his identity and begins his new life as a seven-year-old living with Ran and her private detective father.\n\nMeitantei Conan follows Conan as he continues to solve murder cases, all while slowly working toward exposing the men who shrunk him and eventually restoring his body.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

His fearsome looks make even the toughest of men scream, and if his appearance isn't off-putting enough, he is also known to be extremely brutal in fights. In a single day, he took out the school's top thug and became the new guardian. Now, the entire school is at his mercy, and anyone who dares to challenge him better be ready to meet their maker... or so the stories go.\n\nThe truth is that all of the terrible rumors surrounding Seiichirou are misunderstandings, many assuming the worst about him because of his demon-like features. In reality, he is a kindhearted boy who goes out of his way to help others, but his attempts to do good deeds always get hilariously skewed and miscommunicated—which was the case when he became the new guardian. \n\nTime and time again, Seiichirou tries and fails to prove that he is not the demon that rumors make him out to be. He hopes to one day be able to have friends who look beyond his scary disposition and see him for what he truly is—an angel.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To prevent their daughter from being exposed to these crimes, Tsukasa's parents raised her to be a male. Tsukasa aspires to be a policeman fighting against the yakuza, just like her parents. However, her parents died in the line of work, leaving behind Tsukasa and her 3 brothers to fend for themselves. Tsukasa must thus work as a bodyguard for her classmate, Ryuji, who happens to be the leader of the most powerful yakuza group in Tokyo, to pay off the family's debts.\n\n(Source: ANN, edited)",

        "synopsis": "A seemingly ordinary modern day teenager, Yuri, is suddenly whisked away to the Hittite empire in ancient Anatolia, where an ambitious queen wants the girl for a blood sacrifice in order to murder all heirs but her son, thus seizing control of the throne. Luckily, the timely intervention of Prince Kail saves Yuri from the queen's grasp. Kail promises to send Yuri back to her home, but the queen's persistent schemes to kill them both, plus their growing feelings for each other, keep those plans delayed.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 28: Orontes Renka",

        "synopsis": "It is the Middle Ages, and the remnants of mankind are plagued by paranoia and death. Spoken in fearful whispers, the word \"Yoma\" cuts a clear image into the minds of all: monstrous beings with an insatiable hunger for human flesh. But fear of their gruesome appetite is dwarfed by that of their ability to shapeshift and steal the memories of their last meal. Forever vulnerable to attack, humans live in unease, even among family.\n\nThere are few means to kill a Yoma. The Organization, informally known as \"Claymore,\" is humanity's only line of defense, dispatching half-human, half-Yoma female warriors to purify villages of Yoma. A lonely and dangerous existence, death for these warriors comes with each new assignment. What time is found between trying battles and long, arduous travels is spent in ever-intensifying struggle to resist their Yoma blood and maintain their humanity. Villagers, knowing of this, pay for their security reluctantly and have only loathsome regard for their protectors.\n\nClaymore follows the stoic and low-ranking member Clare in her daunting trek as she searches for personal vengeance. Along the way, she encounters many unexpected things about the world, from the camaraderie and hope held fast by her sisters-in-arms to the sinister truth behind the Claymore Organization.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Thousands of years ago, there existed those gifted with the power of God. Their mission: to destroy the ominous evils that lurk in the darkness known as \"Akuma.\" Led by the Milenium Earl, Akuma seek to destroy fragments of \"Innocence,\" the only weapons capable of harming the Earl and his army and bring about the Great Flood from a hundred years ago. \n\nTo prevent this tragedy from happening, the Black Order was formed as an organization dedicated to fighting the Earl. They recruit Exorcists, those with the inherent ability to accomodate Innocence, to fight against the Akuma.\n\nIn the late 19th century, Allen Walker—a white-haired boy armed with Innocence that takes the form of his entire left arm and a cursed eye that can see Akuma—is sent to the Black Order. There, Allen meets various comrades from the Order—the mercurial Yuu Kanda, the kindhearted Lenalee Lee, and the cheerful yet mysterious Lavi. Despite their different personalities, they have one goal in mind: to bring salvation to the souls of Akuma and prevent the Earl from destroying the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But when he loses his entire family in a tragic car accident, he is forced to leave his home and carefree lifestyle behind and move into a new apartment all by himself. However, his pesky neighbors and lack of money soon become the least of his worries as people around him suddenly begin turning into horrifying monsters, plunging the world into apocalyptic chaos.\n\nThe situation takes a turn for the worse when Hyun realizes that he himself is slowly turning into a monster, while a mysterious voice in his head grows louder and louder. With his time running out, Hyun must work together with his fellow tenants to uncover the cause of the outbreak and find a way to survive in this hopeless new world, all the while fighting to retain his humanity.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the summer of 1983, Rena Ryuuguu and her friends are enjoying their days the way they always have: playing games and living a life of contentment in the village of Hinamizawa. But darkness is forming in Rena's heart, and even her closest friends may not be safe from it.\n\nRena's divorced father has recently found a new girlfriend, a sleazy woman named Rina Mamiya. Rena's hatred of her is solidified when she discovers that the woman and her true boyfriend are trying to swindle Rena's father out of his money. After a tumultuous confrontation with Rina about what she has learned, Rena realizes that she must resort to desperate measures to keep her father safe. When her friends notice that she is acting rather strange, they investigate what she has done, but instead of abandoning her as Rena assumed they would, they band together to support and help her.\n\nHowever, when she discovers a shocking snag in her plans, Rena realizes that she may have trusted the wrong people, and begins to become highly suspicious of her friends and the other townspeople. And as she uncovers the truth about the town's long history of murders and disappearances, she realizes that only drastic actions can save the village from utter destruction.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Vash does not clearly remember the destruction of July, and only wants \"love and peace\", as he puts it; though he is a gunfighter of inhuman skill, he uses his weapons only to save lives wherever he can.\n\nAs the series progresses, more is gradually learned about Vash's mysterious history and the history of the human civilization on Gunsmoke, the desert planet the series is set on. The series is often humorous in tone, but at the same time it involves very serious character development and especially in later episodes it becomes quite emotionally intense. Vash is occasionally joined by a priest, Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who is almost as good a gunfighter as Vash himself, and later is targeted by a band of assassins known as the Gung-Ho Guns for reasons which are mysterious at first.\n\nTrigun evolves into a very serious discussion of the nature of morality, posing questions such as: What is the nature of morality? Can we judge different moral codes? If a person is forced to betray their moral code, does that betrayal invalidate that moral code, and can the person still try to live up to that moral code? Can the person find redemption from their wrongs, and if so, how?\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)",

However, Sano's academy is an all-boys school!\n\nDue to her bright personality, Mizuki quickly befriends her class without drawing suspension to her gender. To her surprise, she ends up being not only Sano's classmate but also his roommate. Though she is now able to admire Sano in close proximity, she learns that Sano has quit high jumping and refuses to pick up the sport ever again for unknown reasons. Moreover, the academy's doctor, Hokuto Umeda, might be onto Mizuki's facade. Now, Mizuki has to find a way to reignite Sano's passion—all without revealing her secret.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Natsu no Ori (The Cage of Summer)\nVolume 4: Kawaki no Tsuki (The Thirsty Moon)",

Ever since the Edo period, Japan's most influential companies have settled their conflicts through ruthless unarmed gladiator battles. In order to facilitate these matches, an underground organization, known as the Kengan Association, was created.\n\nOuma Tokita, a man nicknamed \"The Ashura,\" strives to become the strongest martial artist. To do so, he becomes a Kengan fighter for a company called the Nogi Group. Shortly after, Kazuo Yamashita, an employee with a stale job at the Nogi Group, is asked to become Ouma's manager. Now thrown into harrowing arenas, will this duo be able to survive in the brutal world of Kengan?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In his previous life in modern-day Japan, he was not able to achieve his goals. But now, reborn into a world of magic, he will show the true eminence of shadow!\n\nAs Cid pretends to be just another average mob character, he recruits members to his (fake) organization Shadow Garden, aiming to take down the mysterious cult who lurks in the shadows. With plenty of ad-libs, Cid leads his (fake) organization against the foul (yet surprisingly real) Cult of Diablos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When a person successfully conquers the dungeon, the djinn offers their immense strength in the form of Metal Vessels, recognizing him or her as a worthy king candidate. Adventurers from many empires and kingdoms venture into the dungeons in search of their bountiful treasures and the power of djinns. However, to travel through them is not an easy task, and only Magi—legendary magicians who choose kings and develop countries—can guide people through.\n \nAfter being trapped in a room for most of his life, a young Magi named Aladdin finally sets out on a journey to explore the world along with his friend, a djinn named Ugo, who he can summon from his flute. Through a series of fateful encounters, Aladdin meets new various friends and allies, and together they begin an adventure that will change the fate of the world.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Supernatural monsters known as Curses terrorize humanity from the shadows, and powerful humans known as Jujutsu sorcerers use mystical arts to exterminate them. When high school student Yuuji Itadori finds a dried-up finger of the legendary Curse Sukuna Ryoumen, he suddenly finds himself joining this bloody conflict.\n\nAttacked by a Curse attracted to the finger's power, Yuuji makes a reckless decision to protect himself, gaining the power to combat Curses in the process but also unwittingly unleashing the malicious Sukuna into the world once more. Though Yuuji can control and confine Sukuna to his own body, the Jujutsu world classifies Yuuji as a dangerous, high-level Curse who must be exterminated.\n\nDetained and sentenced to death, Yuuji meets Satoru Gojou—a teacher at Jujutsu High School—who explains that despite his imminent execution, there is an alternative for him. Being a rare vessel to Sukuna, if Yuuji were to die, then Sukuna would perish too. Therefore, if Yuuji were to consume the many other remnants of Sukuna, then Yuuji's subsequent execution would truly eradicate the malicious demon. Taking up this chance to make the world safer and live his life for a little longer, Yuuji enrolls in Tokyo Prefectural Jujutsu High School, jumping headfirst into a harsh and unforgiving battlefield.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

The person one step ahead of him is Chinatsu Kano, a first-year student in senior high and Taiki's crush.\n\nChinatsu is the rising star of the basketball team, and the gap between her and Taiki could not be greater. Although Taiki is a decent badminton player, his popularity is nowhere near Chinatsu's, making it even less likely for his feelings to be reciprocated. However, in a strange twist of fate, she ends up living in Taiki's house!\n\nWanting to become a worthy match for Chinatsu, Taiki pursues the same dream as his crush: to partake in the Nationals.

Well, all alone except for \"Daisy,\" someone that she can always talk to and who never hesitates to cheer her up. However, Teru has never met Daisy, she has no idea what he looks like, and her only means of contacting him is through a cell phone that her brother left for her.\n\nIn stark contrast to the kind words and encouragement Teru receives from Daisy, she gets nothing but grief from the rude school janitor, Tasuku Kurosaki, who forced Teru to work for him after she accidentally broke a window. But while Kurosaki seems like a lazy good-for-nothing who only enjoys making her miserable, is there more to him than meets the eye?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 16: Hetakuso Cupid (The Hopeless Cupid)",

With no place to stay amidst the snowy conditions, Haruki decides to let Narumi stay at his house for the winter. As the affable photographer cracks open his host's frozen heart, Haruki slowly warms up to the beauty of the world around him. Gradually developing a close bond, these polar opposites begin to dread the arrival of spring, as their time together will come to an end once the cold winter passes.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead, she has become a plain and shy girl who spends most of her time and money on her biggest obsession: jellyfish.\n\nTsukimi lives with her fellow niche hobbyists in the all-female Amamizukan apartment complex, where the two most important rules are to avoid stylish people and men. Tsukimi has always abided by these rules until one evening—while rescuing a spotted jellyfish—she encounters a classy, princess-like woman. After allowing the girl to stay the night, Tsukimi is shocked to discover that the person is not a woman at all.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Here, espers are given one of five power levels, the highest of which consists of only seven members. Mikoto Misaka, a middle school electromaster, ranks third among these individuals, and is known as \"The Railgun.\"\n\nIn a city known for housing extraordinary individuals, it comes as no surprise that extraordinary things tend to happen. Recently, makeshift bombs disguised as everyday objects have been ominously finding their way into public areas. Mikoto's best friend, Kuroko Shirai, has been investigating the case as a member of the student-based disciplinary committee Judgement. As more and more of these incidents come to light, it becomes apparent that a hidden darkness exists within Academy City, one that may not only impact Mikoto and her friends, but also the fate of the city itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the blink of an eye, the night sky is forever changed when, with a great explosion, the moon is blasted into a permanent crescent. Confronting the governments of the world, a yellow tentacled monster boasts that it was the one responsible for the catastrophe, and in a year's time, it will do the same to Earth. Zooming around at Mach 20, the creature makes a peculiar demand: a teaching position at the prestigious Kunugigaoka Junior High School. Desperate to keep the creature in one place, the government agrees, and so the students of Class 3-E find themselves faced with an impossible task—assassinate the creature responsible for destroying the moon.\n\nAlthough the fate of the world now rests on their shoulders, the class has more personal issues to deal with. Trapped at the bottom of Kunugigaoka's hierarchical education system, they face harsh discrimination from both teachers and students alike. Defeatism abound, they don't believe themselves capable of success in daily life, let alone against a monster that surpasses the abilities of any human. But as the enigmatic creature—whom they dub Koro-sensei—educates them in both assassination and academia, the children slowly find the courage to rise up and take aim at their target: the greatest teacher the world has ever seen.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 21: Tokyo Department Sensou Taikenki (Tokyo Department Store War Chronicles)",

Two thousand players are already dead.\n\nKirito and Asuna are two very different people, but they both desire to fight alone. Nonetheless, they find themselves drawn together to face challenges from both within and without. Given that the entire virtual world they now live in has been created as a deathtrap, the surviving players of Sword Art Online are starting to get desperate, and desperation makes them dangerous to loners like Kirito and Asuna. As it becomes clear that solitude equals suicide, will the two be able to overcome their differences to find the strength to believe in each other, and in so doing survive?\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

In this alternately heartwarming and bittersweet tale, a young mother tries to cope with both the overwhelming discovery of her child's autism and the trials of raising him while keeping her family together. This is a story that resonates not only for those whose families have been affected by autism, but also for all past, present, and future parents.\n\n(Source: Yen Press)\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 15: Thank You Sensei!, Haru no Manazashi",

Thus, it is no surprise that the one he wants to kill the most is never far off from his mind: the class idol, Anna Yamada.\n\nReading alone in his beloved school library, he inadvertently begins to rendezvous with Yamada, who comes to secretly gorge on her beloved candies and sweets. Through their interactions, Ichikawa discovers just how much of a ditz Yamada is, and cannot help but support her from the sidelines. Meanwhile, Yamada herself cannot help but tease Ichikawa relentlessly due to his flustered reactions.\n\nWith an array of heartwarming daily interactions, the distant bond between the two grows into something more than just library acquaintances. Perhaps, in time, Ichikawa will come to realize that his murderous desires have turned into something else entirely.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This former psychology student is known for single-handedly bankrupting an entire company, and Nao believes he is her only chance at escaping her dire situation. At first, Shinichi is hesitant to commit another crime, ignoring Nao and her request.

He is given into the reluctant care of a minor deity named Konzen, the nephew of the Merciful Goddess Kanzeon Bosatsu. Konzen eventually gives the child the name \"Goku.\" Goku becomes friends with two other minor gods, Marshal Tenpou and General Kenren of the Western Army of Heaven. He also meets a strange little boy who seems to be his own age, the War Prince Nataku. Although Goku is happy in his new home, Heaven is not kind to heretics.

Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.\n\nAfter losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and was cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family's name, he resigned himself to dying alone—until one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko's father sent her to be his bride.\n\nAs she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko's dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Framed for a crime she didn't commit, and manipulated into serving a longer sentence, Jolyne is ready to resign to a dire fate as a prisoner of Green Dolphin Street Jail. Though all hope seems lost, a gift from Joutarou ends up awakening her latent abilities, manifesting into her Stand, Stone Free. Now armed with the power to change her fate, Jolyne sets out to find an escape from the stone ocean that holds her.\n\nHowever, Jolyne soon discovers that her incarceration is merely a small part of a grand plot: one that not only takes aim at her family, but has additional far-reaching consequences. What's more, the mastermind is lurking within the very same prison, and is under the protection of a lineup of menacing Stand users. Finding unlikely allies to help her cause, Jolyne sets course to stop their plot, clear her name, and take back her life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In the spring of their high school days, Yuiji Hasegawa suspects that his kind but quiet classmate, Yamato Yoshinaga, has feelings for his straight best friend, Kyousuke Hongou. Ending up in the same study group, he stumbles upon Yamato holding a sleeping Kyousuke's hand, with embarrassment apparent on his face after being exposed.\n\nDespite having qualms about Yamato's homosexuality, Yuiji keeps what he saw a secret, thus marking the beginning of their friendship. The two boys' experiences with love differ vastly, but their bond seems to grow as they try to understand each other. However, the question remains: could their relationship evolve into something more?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Their chance arrives when they're both invited to audition for a new erotic film.

        "synopsis": "There is said to be a legendary \"Ghost of Akina\" that holds the fastest time to descend the Akina Pass. No one has ever come close to beating the record, nor has the mysterious driver of the white Toyota AE86 ever revealed themselves. Nowadays, the same AE86 can be seen every morning driving up and down the pass, making trips to a hotel residing at the top of the mountain.\n\nUnlike his classmates and coworkers, Takumi Fujiwara did not like cars. Any conversation about them would remind him of his early morning routine of delivering tofu for his father. He did not see the appeal in street racing and knew nothing about its rules or its culture. However, when tagging along to a nighttime meetup, the appearance of a rival racing team at the Akina Pass compels Takumi to hop behind the wheel of his father's AE86 and race them down the familiar mountain.\n\nThis spur-of-the-moment decision marks the beginning of Takumi's high-octane journey, shifting from his daily deliveries to becoming the greatest drift racer ever. Along the way, he slowly finds and kindles his love for street racing as he comes face-to-face with a plethora of opponents, each ready to take on the renowned Ghost of Akina.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Like every protagonist, he has a tragic past: suffering under the thumb of his loathsome shizun, the scum villain Shen Qingqiu.\n\nHowever, despite its great world-building and setup, PIDW eventually went off the rails, abandoning plotlines left and right, and now focusing exclusively on gratuitous sex. This is the very trash-tier web novel that a young millennial named Shen Yuan curses as he dies, swearing that even he could write a better story.\n\nThat moment is when the \"System\" initiates, and Shen Yuan awakens in the body of Shen Qingqiu. His mission? Turn this piece of subpar fiction into a grade-A masterpiece. Constrained by a System that will punish him for even being slightly out of character, Shen Yuan must avoid Shen Qingqiu's fate of becoming a human stick—and step one is to hug the protagonist's thigh!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Ever since he was two years old, he has lived peacefully in his district with a bright future ahead of him. However, on the night of his 12th birthday, his perfect life changed forever.\n\nStanding in front of his room's open window, an unknown injured boy of his age strangles him. Despite being in danger, he insists on tending to the stranger's wounds instead of setting him free. The intruder, a fugitive by the name of Nezumi, reveals to Shion that the city is not as immaculate as it seems. The following day, Nezumi leaves without a trace, and the incident renders Shion and his mother void of their elite status.\n\nFour years after that fateful stormy night, the most unimaginable events transpire, causing Shion to doubt the authorities sworn to protect his home. When he is falsely held responsible for these occurrences, he once again crosses paths with Nezumi, who spares him from permanent captivity. Now, as wanted criminals, Shion and Nezumi have no choice but to explore and unveil the pretentious facade of No. 6.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Middle school student Eijun Sawamura has just lost his final baseball game after pitching a unique fastball that cost Akagi Middle School their chance to reach the nationals. As the baseball team captain, he feels responsible for their enormous loss and vows to take his friends there in high school. However, with his terrible grades and no school recommendations in his area, Sawamura sulks as he tries to figure out how to keep his promise.\n\nHis pitch during the last game catches the attention of a scout from the prestigious Seidou High School in Tokyo, who soon convinces a begrudging Sawamura to observe their school's nationally-ranked baseball team practice. At Seidou, an impromptu competition between Sawamura and one of their batters causes him to cross paths with Kazuya Miyuki—a catcher who can pull out Sawamura's strengths as a pitcher.\n\nThe experience he has accumulated at Seidou changes his initial reluctance to transfer to Tokyo. Although he still feels guilt over betraying his friends, they encourage him to take the offer and enroll in Seidou. Filled with a renewed sense of determination, Sawamura begins the arduous journey of becoming Seidou's team ace and heading for the nationals while carrying the spirit of his former school with him.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, they disappeared during the final stages of their trek, leading to one of mountaineering's greatest mysteries—did the pair ever make it to the summit?\n\n1993, Kathmandu. Japanese photographer Makoto Fukamachi discovers a vintage camera in an antique store, which he believes might have belonged to Mallory. However, the camera falls into the possession of \"Bikha Sanp,\" a burly Japanese man who Fukamachi realizes may very well be Jouji Habu, a legendary Japanese mountaineer who disappeared from the scene several years ago. Unfortunately for Fukamachi however, Bikha Sanp refuses to talk to him and leaves with the camera in tow.\n\nWith the trail gone cold, Fukamachi has only one course left to pursue: to delve into Habu's past and see just what may have brought the former climber to Nepal. For the sake of rewriting mountaineering history, Fukamachi begins his investigation, a task that will bring him to the greatest height in the world—the summit of the gods.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But while riches and renown are incentive enough for most, Bell Cranel, would-be hero extraordinaire, has bigger plans. He wants to pick up girls.\n\nIs it wrong to face the perils of Dungeon alone, in a single-member guild blessed by a failed goddess? Maybe. Is it wrong to dream of playing hero to hapless maidens in Dungeon? Maybe not. After one misguided adventure, Bell quickly discovers that anything can happen in the labyrinth—even chance encounters with beautiful women. The only problem? He's the one who winds up the damsel in distress!\n\n(Source: Yen Press)",

Even now, he still didn't know. Those around him were the same as him, no one remembered anything other than their own names. And when they emerged from the darkness, the world that awaited them seemed like something out of a video game.\n\nIn order to survive, Haruhiro forms a party with the others, learns fighting skills, and as a soldier in the reserve force, takes his first steps into the world of Grimgar. What awaits him there, he doesn't know...\n\nThis is the story of an adventure born from the ashes.\n\n(Source: NanoDesu)",

Now a teenager, she is broke, and is the only one able to financially support her young siblings. She starts auditioning for any role possible, without much success.  \n\nHer luck begins to change when Sumiji Kuroyama, a renowned director, sees Yonagi's performance and is amazed by her ability to immerse herself in the role—the so-called method acting. Although she is a diamond in the rough, if she keeps using the same technique over and over, it could lead to her being severely damaged. So, he makes the decision to help polish her, giving Yonagi the opportunity she needs. However, the road ahead of her is far from easy, and she will need to adapt to overcome the various challenges that come her way.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thus, a manhunt begins for those named Wolfgang.\n\nWolfgang Goldenleonard is well aware of his identity, and he knows that the authorities are still looking for him. He also knows that they mean to end his life. In hiding since the death of his mother, the prince has fostered a bond with the orphans of the streets. However, after threats to them are made, Wolfgang is forced to reveal himself. With his identity publicly revealed, Wolfgang is taken to the home of his tyrannical father.\n\nAt his father's palace, Wolfgang retains his hatred for the man who gave him life. He refuses to behave as befitting of a Goldenleonard prince and breaks every rule he possibly can. He is often reminded that he is never to covet the king's possessions, but through his rebellious spirit and fiery nature, he has already caught the eyes of the king's favorite catamite, Shin Soohyuk.\n\nShin sees Wolfgang as a force for change, the spark that may just light the fires of rebellion. And with the promise of granting Shin's freedom, Wolfgang agrees to become his pawn.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Now that the suspension is over, the only club's members left are interested only in women, smoking and doing nothing until, under professor Kawato's guidance, they discover a new dream called Koushien. The road to Koushien is far from easy, as they have to get back in shape, to learn how to play baseball and to win everyone else mistrust, including the principal's and other professor's one, with only a few months available. Sweating and fighting, the baseball club will find his determination and strength, as they proceed towards their dreams, while Kawato's enthusiastic and non-conventional ways slowly change the attitude of everyone near them.\n\n(Source: ANN)",

        "synopsis": "Beyond the mist-filled alleyways in the concrete crevices of Los Angeles' Chinatown hides a mysterious pet shop, home to many bizarre yet friendly creatures. The store's proprietor is an enigmatic young man who goes by the name of Count D.\n\nCount D welcomes those who feel lonely and wounded through the doors of his shop, claiming to sell \"love, dreams, and hope\" in the form of the fantastic beasts that lie within. Each creature comes with a special contract accompanied by a set of rules. However, he warns customers that he cannot be held accountable for any consequences of breaking the rules.\n\nShort-tempered detective Leon Orcot traces the source of several crimes back to Count D and what the former considers to be a pet shop of horrors. Determined to find proof that the Count is a criminal, he begins to pay regular visits to the shop.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tasked with doing a group assignment alongside freeloaders, Sangwoo decides that it is only logical not to credit them. However, his strict treatment causes his popular senior Jang Jaeyoung to lose the opportunity to graduate and study abroad. Seeing as he did nothing wrong, Sangwoo avoids Jaeyoung's constant phone calls.\n\nAs fate would have it, the two men meet when Sangwoo needs a new graphic designer for the 2D game he is making. Jaeyoung is known for his charming personality, but he actually hides a hot temper. Despite his unchanging situation, Jaeyoung cannot stand Sangwoo's apathetic attitude and decides to get revenge by interrupting everything Sangwoo spent years carefully planning. Sangwoo tries his best to keep his calm, but Jaeyoung's presence and attractive smile may prove to be more than just a bug in his perfectly coded life.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "After his parents died, Shinpei Ajiro lived with the Kofune sisters, Mio and Ushio, but he has since moved to live on his own in Tokyo. But after Ushio drowns while trying to save the young Shiori Kobayakawa, he returns home to mourn her departure. However, bruises around Ushio's neck bring her cause of death into question.\n\nTaking a step back, Shinpei becomes convinced there must be another explanation. Dangerous entities roam among the islanders, and a vision of deceased Ushio asks him to \"save Mio\" as her final request. He is certain that something is afoot—and Ushio's death is only a piece of the puzzle.\n\nWith the help of Mio and various others, Shinpei struggles to forge a future in which he, his friends, and family can stay alive. But the more he investigates, the more impossible such a future seems. This darkness infiltrates his home island. Just how much more suffering will he go through before finding the right path to save it all?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Rather than fretting over relationships or aiming for the national championships, the trio finds themselves trying on skirts, maximizing their summer vacation, and musing with a hopeless romantic by the riverside. The constant clash of their conflicting personalities sparks various events that depict the absurd yet relatable daily lives of high school boys.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Tired of killing and betrayal, he wants to die. However, no method of execution works on him because as much as the seemingly apathetic Gabimaru refuses to admit it, he does have a reason to live. He wants to return to his wife, who was the reason why he softened up and failed to be an effective assassin. Thus, he refuses to die.\n\nAsaemon the Decapitator, a famous executioner, sees this and has a proposal for the ninja. She wants Gabimaru to join an expedition to an island south of Japan in search of the elixir of life in exchange for a full pardon by the Shogunate. However, this island is not a normal island: it is believed to be Paradise.\n\nHowever the island is full of mysteries, and the exploring team—consisting of those marked for death—might not be fully prepared to handle them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

After her class introduction concludes, she finds out that her seat is right next to the boy who helped her earlier that day. Her classmates inform her that he is Yuuji Yugami, the ace of the Baseball Club. However, they also advise her to stay away from him, as he is known to be a bonafide weirdo and his actions are incomprehensible to most people. Unconvinced, she attempts to interact with him, quickly realizing that he is nothing but a pain to talk to and that the rumors were indeed true. \n\nShortly afterward, Chihiro gets entangled in a sticky situation with the third-years, but Yugami once again comes to her rescue, albeit for his own self-righteous reasons. Convinced that there is more to him than meets the eye, she is determined to treat him unbiasedly and to live a normal high school life surrounded by friends.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

But senior Ryou Hanae is the only person that manages to leave Haiga awestruck: with his glorious long hair, stunning features, and incredible musical talent, Hanae finds a lasting spot in Haiga's mind.\n\nWhen Haiga loses a bet against his friends, he finds himself at a box spa—a secluded place that offers intimate same-sex services. Fostering lingering doubts about being bisexual, Haiga sees this as an opportunity to come to a definitive answer. However, in his nervous state, Haiga is unaware that he bought time with none other than his beautiful senior, Hanae.\n\nAll Haiga asks for is an honest conversation about sexual identity, but Hanae insists on a more hands-on approach. Unable to stay away, Haiga continues returning for more, but he must determine if his feelings are genuine love or merely admiration.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

They arrive in Japan to attend school, and soon witness the corruption and apathy of the country's population. Enraged, Akira and Asami vow to create a new Japan; a sanctuary with a new form of politics, devoid of corruption, where people are empowered to participate in the politics and future of their country. To accomplish this, Houjou and Asami aim to conquer Japan through two dramatically different routes: the Japanese Diet and the Yakuza. Decided by a game of rock-paper-scissors, Houjou ventures to seize control of the underworld while Asami pursues the position of Prime Minister.\n\nSanctuary is a dark, political thriller that tells the story of these two friends as they attempt to change Japan from the inside out and create their sanctuary.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Living in a small village and being the only children their age, the two boys find solace in each other's company. Their friendship seems picturesque at first glance, but Yoshiki has noticed a shift in Hikaru's demeanor ever since one fateful summer.\n\nThe \"Hikaru\" that sits beside him now is nothing like his friend. Despite his physical appearance and memories remaining exactly the same, Yoshiki knows something is amiss and that the Hikaru he once knew is gone. When he brings this up, Hikaru partially transforms into an otherworldly being, threatening to kill Yoshiki if he cannot accept it—while also professing its love for him.\n\nWracked with grief and unable to let go of his best friend, Yoshiki struggles to move on with his life as he finds himself getting closer to the new Hikaru. At the same time, strange occurrences begin to plague their village, bringing unsettling chaos.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To prove it is haunted, Mai and her friends try to summon a specter by telling ghost stories. No ghosts appear, but the group encounters Kazuya Shibuya, a 17-year-old transfer student. Though her friends are charmed by Kazuya's attractive looks and great manners, Mai does not trust him.\n\nFollowing a mishap, Mai discovers Kazuya's real identity as the president of Shibuya Psychic Research, a group hired by the school principal to investigate the building's rumored paranormal activity. As a consequence of her actions, Mai must temporarily help Kazuya if she does not want to pay him damages. Joined by other individuals experienced with the supernatural—former Buddhist monk Houshou Takigawa, self-proclaimed Shinto priestess Ayako Matsusaki, famous medium Masako Hara, and Catholic priest John Brown—Mai and Kazuya must uncover the mystery surrounding the building before any more innocent lives are lost.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Guideau, a young woman with the eyes of a beast and a knack for rushing into things head-on, has a deeply personal grudge against witches. Ashaf, a refined yet enigmatic man who carries a coffin on his back, keeps his partner in check with a calm manner and presence of mind. Together, they investigate magical mysteries and crimes, all while looking for the witch who cursed Guideau.\n\nThe pair arrive in a city where they have heard a witch resides; however, much to their surprise, the people of the city consider the witch to be a hero protecting them. Both Guideau and Ashaf believe that only trouble follows a witch wherever she goes—but that remains to be seen here.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shot:\nVolume 6: Majo no Kimagure (Witch and Whim)",

Rather than participating in her physical education class, the young girl crafts a foolproof argument to avoid any activity altogether. Instead of being impressed, Nanoka's worried teacher decides to give her a new task—to find the meaning of the word \"happiness.\"\n\nAs Nanoka mulls over the answer to such a difficult question, she seeks advice from two of her closest friends: Obaa-chan, an elderly woman living in the woods; and Abazure-san, a young woman living alone in a nearby apartment. Along the way, Nanoka befriends high school student Minami at an abandoned building, whom she initially met while Minami was hurting herself.

He has fought long and hard with feelings of being a burden to his loving husband, Hiromu, due to his status as an omega—a secondary gender, allowing one to give birth regardless of if they are male or female—and the difficulty they faced to achieve this domesticity. When their son, Hikari, was born, the family moved to an area better suited for raising children.\n\nHikari is now nearing his second birthday, and he and his parents are forging meaningful bonds with those around them. These include the beta college student living next door, Yuuki, to whom Hikari has become rather attached; Hiromu's friend from work Matsuo; and the mysterious single dad seen wandering around the park.\n\nDespite their newfound domestic bliss, the family's ties to their past are in tatters. There are people they left behind to pursue the creation of their happy family, and when they begin to return, Masaki and Hiromu are not quite sure they have good intentions.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

When the apathetic passenger—Youichi Minagawa—invites him to his residence to make amends for the incident, Sakurai goes without protest.\n\nAside from being a college student, Youichi turns out to own a huge house, which is something unusual for his age. While it piques Sakurai's interest, their unexpected connection does not last long after the compromise was made, and Sakurai returns to his recurring dull life. However, fate seems to have other plans for Sakurai.\n\nDespite not intending to return, he often finds himself back in Youichi's house, and the occurrences that follow draw them closer to each other. In turn, Sakurai starts to take a deeper interest in the young man, while Youichi begins to display a rare side of himself ever since the office worker's appearance.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

This evil's presence has made her bored, aimless, and missing the excitement of her youth, leading her to contemplate what she truly seeks from life. Surprisingly enough, when Meiko proposes the idea of quitting her job to her boyfriend, Naruo Taneda, he groggily agrees.\n\nDeeply inspired by his half-asleep words of encouragement, Meiko hastily leaves her old life behind, looking to begin anew, with Taneda soon following suit. Together, they look toward their dreams from their college days and decide to revive Rotti, Taneda's old band. As the two stand confidently alongside their old friends with instruments in hand, life throws the most unexpected curveball their way, leaving Meiko and her friends to pick up the pieces of what was shattered.\n\nSolanin tells an intimate story about the trials and tribulations of love, loss, and grief centered around people in their twenties who often slip between the cracks of society.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Love can also flourish between unlikely pairs who bury their feelings deep within them, making it harder and harder to say that one notorious phrase in the human language... \"I love you.\"\n\nTsurezure Children follows the journeys of numerous different couples and their romantic escapades. From the butterflies of a confession to the failed attempts at a first kiss, this story sheds light on the challenges and triumphs of young love.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Whatever the reason, Shuli is left to shoulder heavy responsibilities as marchioness after his death. On top of the responsibility to manage a prestigious household with close ties to the empire's royal family, she becomes stepmother to four children who deeply mistrust her.\n\nFor seven years, Shuli dedicates herself to raising the children well and safeguarding the family fortune. She believes she only has to wait until her son Jeremy will take over as head of the family—then she can live freely. However, on the long-awaited day of his wedding, she is caught up in a tragic accident.\n\nWhen Shuli next opens her eyes, she finds herself in the past, hours before Johannes' funeral. Although uncertain why she has been granted a second chance at life, this time she is determined to build relationships with the children as well as allow for her own happiness.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Rakan Sawa is a normal high school student living a quiet life alone, tending to his many lush plants. This peace is disrupted when a foreign man and several dangerous creatures suddenly crash into his garden. The man immediately turns his odd plant-like weapon on Rakan, but after seeing it respond to Rakan's touch, his attitude completely changes. The man, Chigusa, declares that Rakan is a precious \"sanome,\" a person who can cultivate plant life at will.\n\nBeing the last known sanome, Chigusa vows to protect Rakan at all costs and asks for his support. Chigusa is an infamous outlaw that aims to destroy the \"ayame,\" creatures that siphon life from his dying world, including the current prince who oddly looks exactly like Rakan.\n\nRakan travels to Chigusa's desert world that is filled with despondent people, strange creatures, spirits, and magic. Along the way, they gather more followers and supporters in their quest to return green to the barren, decaying land.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Unfortunately, she wakes up from her dream only to find herself in a sinking ship, being rescued by three strangers: Arashi Aota, whose kind-hearted personality does not match his quick temper; Semimaru Asai, who enjoys ridiculing Natsu's meek nature; and Botan Saotome, a skillful woman seemingly aware of their situation. Following the four's successful escape, they sail to a deserted island.\n\nUnbeknownst to them, the mysterious island is Japan. After a meteorite landed on Earth, humanity was wiped out and the environment changed drastically. To repopulate the country, the government initiated the \"7 Seeds\" project, consisting of five groups—Spring, Summer A, Summer B, Autumn, and Winter—each with seven young healthy individuals and a guide. Natsu and the others were put into team Summer B, whose members are considered failures by society.\n\nTo get more supplies, the group must find one of the seven shelters built by the government. In a hostile, unfamiliar world with no loved ones to depend on, the quartet must learn to cooperate with each other to ensure their survival.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Freelance photographer Akihito Takaba is famous for his daring work in field journalism, willing to do anything to ensure the perfect shot and the exposure of evil. On the other hand, Ryuuichi Asami is an elite businessman, known for his chain of high-class nightclubs and entertainment facilities. At least, that's what he appears to be. In reality, Asami is a powerful figure in Japan's underworld, playing his hand in everything from drug smuggling to government scandals.\n\nWhen Akihito sets his viewfinder on Asami's illicit dealings, he has dropped himself into a field he cannot escape from. Asami is not about to let his image get tarnished by a stubborn 23-year-old and will ensure that Akihito is taught a lesson. But Asami has severely underestimated the boy's determination to overthrow him, and suddenly, the two of them find themselves playing an obsessive game of cat and mouse. It is never quite obvious who is the predator, and who is prey.\n\nHowever, when Akihito's job puts him into the sights of an old acquaintance of Asami's—the leader of the Chinese drug syndicate Baishe, Liu Feilong—there seems to be more at stake than a couple of incriminating photographs. Instead, Feilong puts everything on the line in an attempt to use Akihito to draw out the wrath of the man he hates most.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Digital Manga Publishing, under its Juné imprint, acquired the license and released the first volume on September 8, 2010. In 2015, the publisher launched a successful Kickstarter to restock the first six volumes of the series. The license was lost in June 2016 when the publishing agreement between DMP and Libre Publishing had ended. The following month, VIZ Media picked up the license under the SuBLime imprint and published the 8th volume on March 14, 2017.

A boy and a girl, raised in an abandoned virology research center, immune to the virus, are attacked by the Propater and escape.\n\nTwenty years later, the boy is the most powerful drug lord in South America. He aids his son from behind the scenes as he evades and eventually with the help of mercenaries from Nomad (some of them former Propater operatives) fights the Propater. As the plot develops focus shifts away from the main character and develops many sub-plots dedicated to terrorism, Human-improvement, the struggle of the developing countries and the power battles between the drug cartels and Propater.\n\nBased strongly on Gnostic mythology, all major characters are named after gnostic deities, and have analogous roles.\n\n(Source: MU)",

Can she ever turn her boyfriend, anime fanboy Kousaka, into a normal guy? Kanji triumphs where Saki fails, when both Kanji and Kousaka sign up for Genshiken: The Society for the Study of Modern Visual Culture.\n\nUndeterred, Saki chases Kousaka through the various activities of the club, from costume-playing and comic conventions to video gaming and collecting anime figures—learning more than she ever wanted to about the humorous world of the Japanese fan...\n\n(Source: Del Rey Manga)",

One day, Iruma gives an injured old man his last loaf of bread and nurses the stranger back to health—only to find out that the elder gent is none other than Don Sullivan, head of the Babyl Mafia! Soon after, Don Sullivan comes back, whisks Iruma away, and begs the boy to become his grandson. And just like that, Iruma begins his new life as the next in line to lead a gigantic gang of—dare we say—demonic mafiosos!\n\n(Source: Kodansha USA)",

However, fate cannot be more cruel; she is reincarnated as Rudbeckia \"Ruby\" de Borgia, a minor villainess from a novel who grows up in a violent household and dies at the hands of her husband.\n\nRuby's father, the power-hungry pope, wishes to ruin the Britanya Kingdom by marrying Ruby off to Britanya's mightiest knight, Iske van Omerta, and having her poison his beloved sister, Elenia. But Ruby knows his plan will ultimately fail, and no member of the Borgias family will escape Iske's wrath and revenge alive. In order to prove her innocence when the time comes, Ruby must act as an oblivious and docile wife, for only by winning her husband over can she hope to survive.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Making friends when you've got an unintentionally scary face is tough—and don't even get him started on girlfriends. But with his secret crush in his class, the start of his second year of high school is off to a good start...until he crosses paths with Aisaka Taiga. Beautiful, frightening, and not quite five feet tall, the girl known as the Palmtop Tiger is the one person in school even scarier than Ryuuji himself—and he's just made the mistake of making her very, very angry.\n\n(Source: Seven Seas Entertainment)",

One day, he gets caught in a spatial quake despite preemptive warnings. Miraculously surviving the blast, he meets a mysterious girl in its wake, who he soon comes to know as a \"Spirit\"—supernatural beings who are the cause behind these spatial quakes. Coincidentally, he learns of the \"Anti-Spirit Team,\" a specialized military unit tasked with destroying these Spirits with brute force.\n\nAs if these revelations were not shocking enough, Shidou finds himself recruited into working for Ratatoskr, an organization dedicated to peacefully reducing the threat brought by Spirits—with his sister as its commander! As the new weapon of Ratatoskr, Shidou must nullify the Spirits' powers to prevent them from causing more havoc. His line of attack: go on dates with them, sealing the deal with a passionate kiss.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

One night, her childhood friend Hiro Nakamura finds her in a shrine eating cheap convenience store food and offers to take her to a restaurant. Their subsequent heart to heart leads to Hiro suggesting that Mao move in with him.\n\nTo Hiro who has lived apart from his younger siblings all these years after their parents passed away, bringing his family back together in the once-lively Nakamura home begins with the first step of giving Mao a loving place to belong.\n\nWhen Mao reluctantly accepts his invitation, she is surprised at how easy it is to settle in with her longtime friend. Now she must deal not only with mending her relationship with her father and helping the oldest Nakamura brother attain his goal, but also her growing feelings for Hiro.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Instead, an ominous alien mothership looms overhead, engulfing the city skyscape.\n\nThree years ago, they came. The arrival of the \"Invaders\" sparked the greatest war humanity had ever faced—one that threatened to end the world. The Japanese government scrambled to fight the Invaders. Weapons were mass-produced, sparking controversy and pacifist movements.\n\nThat day, everything changed. And yet, nothing has changed. Kadode Koyama and Ouran Nakagawa live their final days like they always have: going to school, playing with friends, and doing what any carefree high school girl would do.\n\nAs they grow up, they come to learn what it truly means to be an adult in a world where adults seem to be demons who only deceive and destroy. They come to learn the real threat to humanity is not the Invaders, but humanity itself.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Somehow, not only is he inhabiting the body of Park Moondae—a 20-year-old orphan who took his own life—but he has also regressed three years into the past. Furthermore, he is unable to find information about his original body anywhere.\n\nRecovering from his surprise, Moondae wonders if his present situation is similar to the action fantasy novels he knows of. To test his theory, he calls for a status window, which actually appears, albeit bearing the worst news possible: \"Debut or Die.\" Unless he debuts as an idol within a year, he will perish.\n\nTo avoid his deadly fate, Moondae must secure a spot on the idol survival show Idol Inc. and improve his abilities to the maximum. Due to his past job as a paparazzo, at least Moondae has some insight into the idol experience. However, one wrong step could put his future career—and entire existence—in jeopardy.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

However, this is no ordinary world; it's the exact same one as a novel she once read. Beloved by her family, it would seem as though she is in a fairy tale. But Raeliana is far from the main character—she is a mere plot device, whose murder at the hands of her fiancé instigates the entire story. \n\nRaeliana has no intention to accept her fate quietly. She sets her eyes on someone in a position of great power—the vieux riche male protagonist Duke Noah Volstaire Wynknight—aiming to completely change the original story. Using her knowledge of future events, Raeliana offers information to Noah on the condition that he acts as her fake fiancé, but the Duke's two-faced nature throws a wrench in her plans!\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

She prefers eating and playing video games to studying, which results in her notably poor grades. She also gets easily upset, whether by baseless insults or reasonable reprimands. It is very unlikely that she could be known as anything but a bad influence and a crybaby, but that begins to change when she meets a black cat.\n\nGiven a special brooch from the black cat named Luna, Usagi can use it to transform into a guardian of justice named Sailor Moon! She is now tasked to protect the Earth from all that is evil and to find both a missing princess and a sacred jewel known as the Mystical Silver Crystal. Whether she likes it or not, Usagi's beautiful transformation marks the start of meeting the mysterious Tuxedo Mask, fighting alongside new comrades, and learning to take responsibility in this acclaimed magical girl classic.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "When a mysterious light suddenly engulfs Earth, humanity is left petrified, frozen in stone. Thousands of years later, the world is teeming with vegetation, and forests have taken the places of cities that once stood proudly. One of the very first to emerge from their stone prison is Taiju Ooki, who finds that his good friend, a brilliant young scientist named Senkuu, has been preparing for his awakening. While Taiju wishes to save the girl he loves, Senkuu is determined to figure out the cause behind the strange phenomenon and restore the world to its former glory.\n\nBut when they free the infamously powerful Tsukasa Shishiou in order to gain an upper hand against the dangers in an unfamiliar world, they realize that their new comrade has other plans. Tsukasa sees their predicament as a chance to start over; free from the corruption and destruction wrought by technology, he will stop at nothing to achieve his goals. With both sides unable to see eye to eye, Senkuu and his devotion to science will clash with Tsukasa and his primal nature in what will truly be a battle of the ages.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

While eating lunch alone one day, he is suddenly approached by a hungry little boy to whom he hands over the onigiri from his meal. When the boy's older brother shows up, Yutaka is introduced to Tane and Minoru Ueda—a pair of siblings with a significant age gap.\n\nWhen Yutaka meets the brothers again, they ask to learn how to make his special rice balls; little Tane insists that they were the best he had ever eaten. Succumbing to Tane's adorable pleas and his own fear of the intimidating Minoru, Yutaka agrees to become their cooking teacher.\n\nAs lessons morph into meals, Yutaka and the siblings grow closer—but Tane and Minoru's close bond draws out uncomfortable memories for Yutaka, and there are feelings lurking beneath the surface of these group meals that were not initially apparent.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "In a series of chance encounters, university students Youichi Arikawa and Shouta Misaki are brought together. When they meet very briefly for the first and second time, Arikawa is not wearing the proper lenses needed to correct his terrible eyesight. All he has to remember Misaki by is a fuzzy impression of his figure and a necklace with a glass flower pendant that he dropped before hurrying away. \n\nEven though they never introduced themselves, Arikawa dreams of Misaki repeatedly, somehow knowing what name to call out in his sleep. When he meets Misaki for a third time, now with clear vision, Arikawa finally sees his face and confirms his name. Although Arikawa is unsure why he is so strongly infatuated by this person, he knows for certain that he cherishes the man in his dreams, so he candidly confesses to Misaki! Can love at first sight strike as strangely as this?\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Giorno Giovanna is a small-time crook with one big dream—to become a \"Gang-Star.\" No ordinary thief, Giorno has a connection to the remarkable Joestar bloodline, and possesses a Stand named Gold Experience. His dream starts to become reality when he meets Bruno Bucciarati, a mobster from the gang Passione and a fellow Stand user himself. Realizing that they share similar ideals, and both disagree with the gang's harmful affairs, Giorno reveals his goal to Bruno: with Bruno's help, he will reform Passione by overthrowing the boss.\n\nAs Giorno becomes a member of Passione, and is inducted into Bruno's squad, he discovers that it is no simple gang; its numbers are teeming with Stand users. Now confronted by other squads of differing loyalties and unpredictable caliber, their goal to change the gang from the inside out will be a tough one. Taking on these adversaries, Giorno attempts to rise through the ranks and inch closer to the boss, a man who is shrouded in mystery. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

To prevent this from happening, heroes known as the Braves of the Six Flowers are chosen by the Spirit of Fate, and marked with a crest as the saviors of the world. No matter what, there are always six heroes—but this time when the chosen convene, seven arrive.\n\nAdlet Mayer, self-proclaimed \"strongest man in the world,\" is one of the seven Braves. Among others, there is also first princess Nashetania Loei Piena Augustra, loyal knight Goldov Auora, feline-esque assassin Hans Humpty, childish yet deadly Chamo Rosso, the stern Mora Chester, and loner Fremy Speeddraw. Though all are likely candidates for being Braves, there is only one explanation for the extra hero—the seventh is an infiltrator attempting to sabotage their mission and tear apart the Braves from within.\n\nWith all evidence pointing to him, Adlet becomes the prime suspect, and finds himself on the run, desperately attempting to prove his own innocence. But as the clock continues to tick down, and as the Braves turn on each other, the Evil God's minions restlessly await its return.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

On October 23rd, he returns home after a pleasant night of drinking and goes to bed. To his surprise, when Eiji wakes up, a gorgeous girl from his university, Kyouka Yukimura, is lying beside him—claiming to be his girlfriend.\n\nHaving no recollection of the event, Eiji goes along with the flow until he is faced with more nonsensical events that took place in the last few days. Walking alongside his friend, Kashiwagi, he cannot help but ask the most intuitive question on his mind: is today not the 24th? \"Eiji, what are you saying? Today's the 27th.\"\n\nThree days have passed, yet Eiji cannot recall a thing. The situation takes a dire turn when a magazine writer exposes Eiji's deepest secret in front of Kyouka: he is the son of a serial killer. As his life is thrown into a spiral of disarray, he embarks on a journey to resolve the mess of the last three days and get Kyouka to accept his past.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "While mahjong is a game that is often played with family and friends, it is also a game that is played in the darkest corners of society. Nangou is a compulsive gambler who has accumulated a debt of over three million yen. In a last-ditch attempt to clear his record, he decides to wager his life on a game of mahjong with the mafia. Unfortunately, as the game progresses, Nangou only moves further from the prize and closer to death.\n\nWhen all hope seems lost, the game parlor is suddenly intruded upon by Shigeru Akagi, a young boy on the run from the police. Desperate to turn the game around, Nangou hands the game over to Akagi after teaching him a few of the rules. The mafia can only smirk as Akagi sits down to play. However, they soon come to learn that Akagi is a natural-born gambler. An imposing figure who does not fear death. One who is destined to become a legend.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
        "background": "Akagi: Yami ni Oritatta Tensai was adapted into two V-Cinema films that were released in 1995 and 1997. It was also adapted into a Japanese live-action TV series with two sequel seasons. Multiple games based on the manga have also been released.",

Elva—one of the chosen ones—fulfills this duty, beset with a cursed body that has stopped growing, and in isolation from others. When a boy named Alto learns of Elva's circumstances, he wishes to free Elva from this role. In order to support him, Alto reaches out to Elva, whom no one had dared approach before, and vows to stay by his side forever. After eight years that these two opposites had lived together like master and servant, like a family... Elva's body, supposedly only holding out for a few years, has started showing signs of recovery for an unknown reason.\n\n(Source: Shu-Cream, translated)",

        "synopsis": "Fourteen-year-old thug Yuusuke Urameshi spends his days skipping school and causing trouble for the adults in his life. Yuusuke regularly engages in street brawls against rival Kazuma Kuwabara and ridicules his childhood friend Keiko Yukimura. Filled with self-loathing and the burden of an alcoholic mother, Yuusuke sacrifices it all in a split-second decision—he tackles a small child out of the way of an oncoming car, losing his life in the process.\n\nSpirit guide Botan intervenes, allowing Yuusuke to see how the people in his life react to his death; he is moved by the emotional ruin his loss causes his mother, Keiko, and even Kuwabara. Additionally, due to his death's heroic nature, he receives an opportunity to return to life from the Spirit World ruler's son, Koenma.\n\nKoenma hires Yuusuke as a \"Spirit Detective\" and tasks him with solving a series of increasingly challenging paranormal mysteries. Battling and befriending demons such as the beautiful Kurama and hostile Hiei, Yuusuke further develops and utilizes his skills as a fighter. But as dark forces move in the Underworld, Yuusuke struggles alongside his companions to defend everything he took for granted.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "The apartment complex on the infamous Ira Street is a last resort for those fortunate enough to scrape together a few pennies. People deal with poverty and violence daily, and now a string of murders has solidified fear into their bones. Shavonne, an aspiring young writer, is no exception: he struggles to hold a job, his love life is in shambles, and it seems like he even has a stalker. But the bleakness of his days changes when he meets his next-door neighbor, Lewellyn.\n\nLewellyn is charming and undoubtedly handsome, but he is rather eccentric. Day after day, he sits on the staircase and peels onions, and his wealth is too suspicious for an Ira Street resident. Despite the warning signs, Shavonne accepts a dinner invitation from Lewellyn. However, during the candlelit dinner, Shavonne stumbles upon a mutilated corpse—later discovered as evidence of the Ira Street murderer's latest crime.\n\nAs Shavonne tiptoes around Lewellyn trying to save his own skin, strange things begin to happen, and he wonders if Lewellyn is his enemy or the only one truly on his side.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Thinking that the stranger is a client for his side business—gay prostitution—Oz takes him up to his room for a rendezvous. Following an unusual conversation and a sudden kiss, Oz learns that the boy, Theodore Sullivan, came to the bar because he is on his Rumspringa, the time when young Amish people leave their communities to experience the outside world. The pair form an unlikely bond soon after, but the differences between their upbringings threaten to tear the two apart—especially when Oz learns what happens at the end of Rumspringa.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Miyoko Tanashi lived a charmed life with her parents, but after losing both of them in a devastating train accident, the life she knew was suddenly ripped away. Sent to a secluded orphanage in the mountains, she is subjected to inhumane abuse at the hands of her caretakers; escape is not an option since runaways are met with a fate far worse than death. But eventually, Miyoko manages to flee and receive aid from her father's mentor—a researcher named Dr. Hifumi Takano.\n\nAdopted by Hifumi and finally free from her hell, Miyoko takes on a different identity to go along with her new life. When Hifumi's research on a mysterious disease in a mountain village is ridiculed, Miyoko makes it her life's work to prove that the disease truly exists. However, her mission soon turns into a deadly obsession once she arrives in the village, as she is more than willing to prove the doctor's findings by any means necessary...\n\nIn the conclusion to the Higurashi story, warring fates and indomitable wills clash in this final confrontation in June of 1983.\n\n[Written MAL Rewrite]",

Her mother, Ye Feii, was Taiwan's top model, and her father was also a model, until a tragic airplane crash left Lele without parents.\n\nTherefore it is no surprise that Lele hates the industry, thinking it superficial and unnecessary. Raised by her paternal grandmother, Lele reaches seventeen before she is sucked in by her mother's sister, Ye Feihung, a fashion agent (and former model) who \"convinces\" the reluctant Lele to pose. Lele is averse to the whole idea, until she sees a photo shoot of popular American model Angus Lanson, and she begins to see modeling as an art form.\n\nWhen Aunt Feihung's magazine editor invites Angus Lanson to a meeting of all the top fashion ambassadors, Lele is invited along and is curious to meet Angus. She does not know that Angus' twin elder brother, Eros Lanson, is secretly accompanying his brother. This obviously leads to confusion and is the start of a charming story of Lele's goals: Fashion in New York city, becoming a top model, and love? \n\n(Source: ShoujoMagic)",

But when she reveals her identity as a fallen angel and tries to kill Issei, his death seems imminent—until an upperclassman named Rias Gremory rescues him. When he wakes up again, she reveals herself to be a devil. In order to save Issei, she reincarnated him as one of her kind, making him her new servant.\n\nThis turn of events thrusts Issei into the world of the supernatural. As he is introduced to the various devils in the Occult Research Club at his high school, he must learn to adapt to this new world filled with devils and fallen angels. Setting his sights on becoming powerful, he must decide what is truly important to him as he comes to realize that the life of a devil is not an easy one.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

In an orphanage that raises children as soldiers, death is nothing new to the residents. With their home country embroiled in a war that has dragged on for too many years and shows no signs of stopping, the institution's children are sent off to die in battle every day. In contrast to the other orphans, Sheena is deeply disturbed by the ongoing conflict and wishes for it to end.\n\nOn the night of her roommate's death, Sheena met a blood-covered girl who remained jubilant despite the condition she was in. The next day, the girl appears as a new student in Sheena's class and introduces herself as Mimi Kagari. Initially thought to be a school myth, Mimi is said to be the secret weapon of the orphanage—a girl who cannot die. Assigned as Sheena's new roommate, Mimi hopes to get along with her and get accustomed to school life.\n\nHowever, unsettled by Mimi's carefree attitude toward the war, Sheena struggles to accept the world they live in, all while their unusual friendship flourishes amid the bleak situation.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

        "synopsis": "Nothing is beyond Naoto Yanagi, heir to the Yanagi business conglomerate. Idolized for his athletic and intellectual competence, looks and wealth, Naoto lived like a king during his elementary school days—then entered Mikoto Kujou, a plain, gloomy-looking transfer student.\n\nDue to her low financial status, Naoto was initially apathetic towards Mikoto. But despite having just arrived at his school, she completely eclipsed him in everything by consistently scoring top marks in exams and placing first in athletic events. After a brief confrontation with her that left him shocked, Naoto vowed to outdo her no matter the cost.\n\nTen years later, they are now students attending the same college. Having failed to defeat Mikoto throughout middle and high school, Naoto decides they will have one last game: if he can make Mikoto fall in love with him and then break her heart, it will be his victory. However, he finds himself falling in love with her instead...\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]\n\nIncluded one-shots:\nVolume 1: Kimi to, Shiawase.

His only goal is to find the Tear Jewel, the purest tear shed by a human at death's door. So far, all of his victims have failed to give Blood what he wants until he meets his newest prey: 18-year-old Ishuca Lake Sierra Vise Ell.\n\nHowever, Ishuca is unlike any other human Blood has ever met. In the presence of the demon, Ishuca never cowers in fear and even wishes to be eaten by Blood, as he is soon to die due to a heart condition. Although taken aback by Ishuca's kindhearted nature, Blood warms up to the boy and his tragic circumstances.\n\nSadly, Ishuca's illness rapidly catches up to him and he is soon on his deathbed. Wanting to save him, Blood manages to shed the Tear Jewel, which he uses to revive Ishuca. Unaware of everything that happened, Ishuca asks Blood if he can join the demon on his next adventure. With Blood now also free from his prison, he agrees to allow his partially-human companion to accompany him into the unknown that awaits them.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
